"However, in the conventional aerial vehicle described above, the balloon has a problem that it is difficult to control the direction of movement of the balloon to be greatly affected by the wind because the balloon is not provided with the power source for horizontal movement, and hence, the balloon is unsuitable for carrying a load and a person. Further, the airship has a problem that, since the airship has a balloon which is an elongated elliptical body, the airship easily receives wind resistance and hence cannot quickly move or change its moving direction.', 'Further, it is also reported that the conventional drone, including the unmanned aerial vehicle described in Patent Literature 1, crashes at the rate of once every 20 flights due to troubles, such as battery exhaustion (the current average flight time is only about 20 minutes), drive source failure, and damage of the propeller. Therefore, the conventional drone has high risk of accident caused by falling and of damage of the vehicle body. Further, the conventional drone performs the vertical movement and the horizontal movement by a common propeller oriented only in the vertical direction, and hence has the problem that the horizontal mobility capability is low. Further, the conventional drone needs to have a propeller larger than the vehicle body, and hence has the problem of noise and the problem of high danger when in contact with a person, or the like.', 'The present invention has been made in order to solve the above-described problems. An object of the present invention is to provide a buoyant aerial vehicle which can reduce the risk of crashing to thereby secure high safety, and which can suppress the influence of wind to thereby facilitate the control of movement and exhibit high mobility capability.",2

"When hydrosilylation reaction of an aliphatic unsaturated group-containing compound with a silane or polysiloxane having a Si—H group is carried out using a mononuclear iron complex compound of the invention as the catalyst, addition reaction can occur under conditions from room temperature to 100° C. In particular, addition reaction with industrially useful polysiloxanes, and trialkoxysilanes and dialkoxysilanes takes place in an effective manner. Although the known documents indicate that in the relevant reaction, addition reaction to unsaturated group and dehydrogenation silylation reaction to form unsaturated group-containing compounds often take place concurrently, the use of the inventive catalyst ensures selective progress of addition reaction to unsaturated group.

"In the ball joint according to Patent Literature 1, a main body part of the resin-made ball seat is fixed to the housing by thermal tightening.', 'In this respect, let us assume a case where the ball seat is fixed to the housing by insert injection molding where the resin (from which to mold the housing) is injected into a mold with the ball seat (and the support bar) inserted in the mold while the ball part of the ball stud is being held in the ball seat, instead of by heat-staking. In such a case, after the insert injection molding, the housing suffers from molding shrinkage (a phenomenon where the volume of the resin injected into the mold shrinks after the resin is cooled), and accordingly constricts the ball part of the ball stud (with the ball seat interposed in between). Thus, there is likelihood that the ball joint has difficulty in appropriately managing the torque which causes the ball part to slide over the housing.', 'The present invention has been made with the above situation taken into consideration.

"The inventors took note of the fact that, to improve steel sheet for hot stamping use in delayed fracture resistance, trapping the hydrogen which penetrates the steel sheet is effective and engaged in intensive research based on that. As a result, they discovered that it is possible to cause the formation of Fe—Mn-based composite oxides in steel sheet and trap the hydrogen at the interfaces of the composite oxides and the matrix steel and thereby completed the present invention.', 'In large C content high strength steel sheet, usually the inclusions of metal oxides become defects. For this reason, as much as possible, the oxygen in the steel is removed and formation of metal oxides is suppressed. Therefore, in addition to adding Al and other deoxidizing elements, the concentration of oxygen is reduced at the stage of molten steel.', 'However, to cause the formation of Fe—Mn-based composite oxides in the steel like in the present invention, it is necessary to leave oxygen in the steel to a certain extent. Further, C itself has a deoxidizing action, so in general, with large C content steel sheet, the oxygen in the steel ends up becoming small in amount.', 'Therefore, the inventors discovered that by reducing the concentration of Al in the steel sheet, weakening the deoxidizing effect, and securing a concentration of oxygen in the steel, it is possible to cause the formation of composite oxides even in large C content steel sheet.', 'Further, they discovered that to raise the hydrogen trapping effect of composite oxides, it is effective to crush the composite oxides and increase their surface area. They discovered that by crushing and making the composite oxides finer, their effect as defects falls and this leads to an improvement in the performance of the steel sheet.', 'Furthermore, they learned that if there are voids around the composite oxides, the hydrogen trapping effect is improved more.', 'The inventors engaged in intensive studies on the method of production for the above.', 'They learned that large C content molten steel is high in viscosity, so Fe—Mn-based composite oxides have difficulty rising and steel Fe—Mn-based composite oxides can be easily formed in the steel.', 'Further, it was learned that by rolling (hot rolling or further cold rolling) a slab comprised of steel in which Fe—Mn composite oxides are formed, the composite oxides can be stretched and crushed. In this way, they discovered that it is possible to efficiently form hydrogen trap sites in steel sheet which do not become starting points of cracks.

"Prior art solutions which only generate a signature over a high level abstract digital representation of the data to be signed may give rise to a digital equivalent of the ‘small-print’ problem of paper contracts (whereby one party of the contract denies having been aware of certain sections of the contract at the time of signing, for example because these sections were in illegible small print on the back side). Indeed, since only a high level abstract digital representation of the application data is signed a dispute may arise between an application owner and an application user over what the exact contents were of the analog representation of those data that the computer system of the application user generated and subsequently displayed to the user because the exact way that the high level abstract application data are transformed into the analog representation presented to the user may depend on the exact characteristics and configuration of the user\'s system. It may be very hard for either party to the dispute to prove what was really displayed to the user because the state of the system that the user used to review the application data and generate the signature may no longer be accessible or may have evolved and be no longer reconstructable by the time the dispute erupts. By providing a signature over a low level digital representation of the data which is guaranteed to correspond exactly to the analog representation that was effectively displayed to the user and then observed and approved by the user, the invention solves this problem.

"In the field of internal combustion engines such as a gasoline engine and a diesel engine, there has been known one type of engine whose combustion mode is switchable according to an engine operation state. For example, in the field of diesel engines, there has been known one type of diesel engine whose combustion mode is switchable between a diffusion combustion mode in which fuel is combusted while being injected into a cylinder, and a premixed combustion mode in which fuel is ignited after being preliminarily mixed with air in a cylinder.', 'Assume that, in a control device for such an engine, a current target torque is instantaneously reduced by the vehicle behavior control device described in the Patent Document 2, so as to generate vehicle deceleration according to manipulation of a steering wheel by a driver. In this case, the combustion mode of the engine can be switched from the diffusion combustion mode to the premixed combustion mode, in response to the change in the target torque. During the diffusion combustion in which fuel is combusted while being injected into a cylinder, with a view to suppressing degradation of emission quality due to incomplete combustion, an oxygen concentration in a cylinder (in-cylinder oxygen concentration) is set to a relatively high value, as compared to during the premixed combustion. Thus, when the combustion mode is switched from the diffusion combustion to the premixed combustion, the in-cylinder oxygen concentration needs to be reduced.', 'Specifically, when a fuel injection amount is reduced so as to instantaneously reduce the target torque, the in-cylinder oxygen concentration needs to be reduced according to the reduction in the fuel injection amount. However, control of the in-cylinder oxygen concentration cannot catch up with the reduction in the fuel injection amount, causing a relative increase in the in-cylinder oxygen concentration. As a result, an actual in-cylinder oxygen concentration becomes higher than a suitable in-cylinder oxygen concentration for the premixed combustion, and resulting abnormal combustion such as premature ignition undesirably causes generation of knock noise.', 'The present invention has been made to solve the above conventional problem, and an object thereof is to provide a control device for an engine whose combustion mode is switchable according to an engine operation state, wherein the control device is capable of controlling the engine to accurately realize vehicle behavior intended by a driver, while suppressing generation of knock noise due to abnormal combustion.",2

"The microneedle deposition method related to the present invention made to solve the above-mentioned problems is characterized in that', 'a) the microneedle array is prepared using an water-soluble polymer as a base material,', 'b) a drug solution to be applied to the tips of the microneedle array is prepared,', 'c) the tips of the microneedle array are contacted with the drug solution for a short time, to manufacture the microneedle array in which the drug is deposited on the tips.', 'For efficiently applying the drug to the tips of the microneedle array, the base material for the microneedle array and the drug solution is preferably compatible with each other. For this reason, both the drug and the base material for the microneedle are preferably water-soluble. The drug solution may be a mixture of water as a main component and an organic solvent miscible therewith. Examples for the organic solvent miscible with water are ethanol and acetone.', 'Furthermore, a viscosity of the drug solution is preferably increased by dissolving a water-soluble polymer in the drug solution. This is because the increase of the viscosity by dissolution of the water-soluble polymer results in the increase of the amount of the drug solution deposited on the tip of the microneedle. The concentration of the water-soluble polymer in the aqueous solution is 1-20%, preferably 2-15%. The lower the concentration of the water-soluble polymer is, the small the amount of the drug solution deposited through the contact with the needle is. In addition, if the concentration is too high, its fluidity diminishes, and the deposition cannot be smoothly conducted.', 'The proper concentration of the water-soluble polymer in the drug solution can be decided depending on the viscosity of the drug solution. Preferable viscosity of the drug solution for deposition of the drug ranges 1.0 dPa·s to 90 dPa·s. If the viscosity of the drug solution is less than 1.0 dPa·s, the amount of deposition is small due to very low viscosity. In addition, if it is more than 90 dPa·s, the drug solution is likely to be stringy when the needle is separated from the solution after the contact with the drug solution. Note that all the viscosities are values at room temperature (25° C.).', 'If the time for contacting the tips of the microneedle array with the drug solution is too long, the base material for the water-soluble microneedle is dissolved in drug solution, and thus the time is preferably 0.01 to 5 seconds.', 'The drug solution is prepared by combining the drug and the water-soluble polymer as a base material for the microneedle, thereby the tips are partially dissolved when the microneedle tips are soaked in the drug solution, and therefore the drug is incorporated integrally with the water-soluble polymer in the microneedle tips. Thus, in the microneedles in which the drug is integrated with the base material, the deposition part i.e. the drug is not removed during insertion into the skin, and the drug is completely incorporated into the body.', 'Herein, the term “integrally” means that there is no definite boundary surface between the original microneedle tip and the newly-deposited part. In the boundary part, the drug is considered to have a concentration gradient. The method characterized by such integration is called a deposition method.', 'The drug in the present invention is defined to include all of substances which may cause some effects by being incorporated in a body.', 'This method is appropriate to use when an expensive drug or a drug difficult to obtain in a large amount should be transdermally administered to a human body. For an inexpensive drug and a drug available in a large amount, the drug may be initially mixed with a base material for the microneedle to prepare a microneedle from the mixed base material according to a conventional method.', 'When a drug is dissolved only in organic solvents, a solution prepared by dissolving the drug in the organic solvent is mixed in an aqueous solution of a water-soluble polymer to prepare an aqueous solution of the drug, and then the same procedure can be used. Even when the drug is not completely dissolved in the water-soluble polymer and suspended in a particle form, the deposition and intracorporal administration can act in the same manner as in the case of complete dissolution of the drug if the suspension is uniform and the particle size is a few μm or less.', 'As an example of a drug suitable for the object of the present invention, any drug which exerts effectiveness at few mg of intracorporal administration may be the subject matter, and particularly it is effective for polymer drugs. Its example may include bioactive peptides and derivative thereof, nucleic acids, oligonucleotides, various antigen proteins, bacteria, virus fragments and the like.', 'Examples of the bioactive peptides include insulin, exendin-4, exendin-4 derivative, calcitonin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, parathyroid hormone (PTH), hPTH (1→34), secretin, oxytocin, angiotensin, β-endorphin, glucagon, vasopressin, somatostatin, gastrin, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, enkephalin, neurotensin, atrial natriuretic peptide, growth hormone, growth hormone releasing hormone, bradykinin, substance P, dynorphin, thyroid stimulating hormone, prolactin, interferon, interleukins, G-CSF, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, desmopressin, somatomedin, endothelin, skin-related growth factors such as EGF and FGF, botulinum toxin, and salts thereof. Examples of the antigen proteins and the virus fragments include influenza antigen, tetanus antigen, diphtheria antigen, HBs surface antigen, and HBe antigen. It is necessary that these are dissolved in an aqueous drug solution of the present invention or uniformly dispersed in suspension.', 'Examples of the suitable base materials of the microneedle include the water-soluble natural polymer material such as hyaluronic acid, collagen and dextrin, dextran, chondroitin sulfate, gelatin, proteoglycan, etc. The synthetic polymer materials such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol (partially saponified), polyacrylic acid (salt), etc. can also be used. Also, the physical properties of the microneedle can be improved by blending polymers with each other or blending with low-molecular water-soluble substances. Adding various tapes such as an adhesive tape and a cover sheet to the microneedle array manufactured as above in order to facilitate its use results in a microneedle patch containing the drug only in the tips.', 'In many methods as conventionally reported in which a drug is impregnated in both the needle portion and the substrate portion, even if the substrate portion is thinned, the thinness is limited and requires at least 50 μm. In that case, there is a drawback that the substrate portion contains a larger amount of drug compared to the microneedle array, and the drug in the substrate portion is not administered into the skin (Patent Document 7).', 'Also, there is a trial for compensating for the above-mentioned drawback, in which a base material solution containing a drug is casted onto a mold for microneedle, dried, and then the base material for the substrate is removed while the microneedles remain, to which a base material solution containing no drug is casted and dried to form a substrate (Patent Document 10). However, this method has a drawback that the drug diffuses in the base material solution of the substrate at a time of application of the base material solution and the amount of the drug in the needle parts is decreased.', 'For these points, see Comparative Examples 1 and 2 in Examples.",0

"The scroll compressor according to Patent Literature 1 employs a balance-weighted slider. The balance-weighted slider includes a slider portion positioned on the inner peripheral side of an orbital bearing, and a balance weight portion positioned on the outer peripheral side of the orbital bearing, the slider portion and the balance weight portion being continuous with each other. The center of gravity of the balance-weighted slider is eccentric in a direction opposite to the direction in which the orbiting scroll is eccentric. Hence, part or the whole of the centrifugal force acting on the orbiting scroll is cancelled out by the centrifugal force acting on the balance-weighted slider. Therefore, the forces that press the scroll laps against each other can be prevented from becoming excessively large.', 'In the scroll compressor according to Patent Literature 1, however, the balance weight portion projects to the outer side of the orbital bearing. Therefore, when the balance-weighted slider rotates, the balance weight portion rotates on the outer side of the orbital bearing.

"Unfortunately, reaction of a film containing silicon such as Si3N4 with fluorine generates reaction heat. The heat thus generated has a high temperature. A failure to sufficiently dissipate the reaction heat of the film formation mask during the cleaning of the film formation mask increases a temperature of the film formation mask. This can lead to deformation (elongation) of the film formation mask due to thermal expansion.', 'Especially, in a case where cleaning gas exiting means is provided outside the chamber, radicals in the cleaning gas decrease while the cleaning gas is introduced into the chamber. This tends to cause a longer cleaning time and an increase in amount of usage of cleaning gas. This is more likely to cause deformation of the film formation mask.', 'Deformation of the film formation mask leads to change in clearance between the substrate and the film formation mask, thus causing problems such as a failure to form a film with an intended pattern.', 'Further, when fluorine-based plasma originating from an etching gas directly impinges on the lower electrode, the lower electrode is worn out. When a cleaning gas is blown on the film formation mask through the upper electrode, irregular etching of the lower electrode proceeds in one or more regions of the lower electrode which is/are located at a position(s) corresponding to the one or more openings of the film formation mask in a plan view (i.e., when viewed from above the film formation mask).', 'The present invention has been attained in view of the above problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a cleaning method, a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, and a plasma treatment apparatus all of which make it possible to prevent deformation of a film formation mask. Further, another object of the present invention is to provide a cleaning method, a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, and a plasma treatment apparatus all of which make it possible to prevent deformation of a film formation mask and local wearing of a lower electrode.",2
"To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a battery system comprising: one or more lithium ion secondary batteries each having a power generating element and an electrolyte being impregnated in the power generating element and containing lithium ions; charge and discharge control means for controlling charging and discharging of each of the lithium ion secondary batteries; and internal resistance detecting means for performing at least one of detection and estimation about a level of internal resistance in at least one of the lithium ion secondary batteries; wherein the charge and discharge control means comprises: a plurality of mode control means for controlling charging and discharging each of the lithium ion secondary batteries on a predetermined charge and discharge condition, the mode control means including: increasing mode control means for controlling charging and discharging each of the lithium ion secondary batteries on an increasing charge and discharge condition, the increasing mode control means being configured to gradually increase the internal resistance of each of the lithium ion secondary batteries by continuously performing charge and discharge control; and decreasing mode control means for controlling charging and discharging each of the lithium ion secondary batteries on a decreasing charge and discharge condition different from the increasing charge and discharge condition, the decreasing mode control means being configured to gradually decrease the internal resistance of each of the lithium ion secondary batteries by continuously performing charge and discharge control; mode selecting means for selecting one mode control means to be used from the plurality of mode control means, wherein the mode selecting means is configured: to select the decreasing control means when the internal resistance detecting means detects or estimates that the internal resistance is relatively high; and to select the increasing control means when the internal resistance detecting means detects or estimates that the internal resistance is relatively low.', 'The battery system of the invention includes the internal resistance detecting means, the increasing mode control means, the decreasing mode control means, and the mode selecting means. Thus, for example, when the charging and discharging of each of the lithium ion secondary batteries (hereinafter also simply referred to as “battery(s)”) is controlled by the increasing mode control means and then the internal resistance of each of the batteries gradually increases and becomes relatively high, the charge and discharge control is switched from the increasing mode control means to the decreasing mode control means. As a result, the internal resistance of each of the batteries can be decreased to restore the degradation of the battery. Conversely, when the charging and discharging is controlled by the decreasing mode control means and then the internal resistance of each of the batteries gradually decreases and becomes relatively low, the charge and discharge control is switched to the increasing mode control means, which can prevent the internal resistance from excessively decreasing or can prevent the internal resistance from rather increasing due to continuous control by the decreasing mode control means for decreasing the internal resistance. In this way, the internal resistance of each of the batteries can be constantly restrained within the appropriate range.', 'A method for detecting or estimating the level of the internal resistance using the internal resistance detecting means involves, for example, determining a value of the internal resistance detected or estimated (or a value of physical quantity to be described later) by comparison with a threshold. A predefined value can be used as the threshold. Alternatively, an appropriate value measured or computed after the start of use of each of the batteries can also be used as the threshold.', 'On the other hand, a method for detecting or estimating a value of the internal resistance involves, for example, detecting the internal resistance by measurement of DC resistance or impedance of the battery(s) to be detected. Other methods may include a method for estimating the internal resistance value by measuring a physical quantity having a correlation with the internal resistance, for example, by measuring a lithium ion concentration of an electrolyte (a retained electrolyte or a stored electrolyte) in the battery(s) to be detected, and a method for estimating the internal resistance by computation from a battery used state (the number of charging and discharging, the magnitude of charge current or discharge current, the ambient temperature, or the like).', 'The internal resistance of each of the batteries gradually changes by repeated charging and discharging. For example, in order to discharge the same electrical quantity, the following cases are supposed: a case in which the discharge current is continuously controlled to be relatively large, and a case in which the discharge current is continuously controlled to be relatively small. In the latter case, the increase in internal resistance of each of the batteries can be suppressed, or rather decreased as compared to the former case.', 'In contrast, in order to charge the same electrical quantity, the following cases are supposed: a case in which the charge current is continuously controlled to be relatively large, and a case in which the charge current is continuously controlled to be relatively small. In the former case, the increase in internal resistance of each of the batteries can be suppressed, or rather decreased as compared to the latter case.', 'As can be seen from consideration of, for example, a hybrid electric vehicle, in actual use of each of the batteries, the battery is hardly driven according to a constant charge and discharge pattern, but driven according to a combination of various charge and discharge patterns. However, when observing the internal resistance for a long time to some degree (for example, for three or more months), a condition for gradually increasing the internal resistance and a condition for gradually decreasing the internal resistance exist depending on setting conditions of charging and discharging.', 'That is, the decreasing charge and discharge condition is a charge and discharge condition in which the internal resistance of each of the batteries is gradually decreased by repeatedly charging and discharging each of the batteries by the decreasing mode control means corresponding to the condition. Thus, the charge and discharge conditions for gradually decreasing the internal resistance of each of the batteries include, for example, a discharge condition for making the discharge current relatively small during discharging or a charge condition for making the charge current relatively large during charging.', 'The increasing charge and discharge condition is a charge and discharge condition in which the internal resistance of each of the batteries is gradually increased by repeatedly charging and discharging each of the batteries by the increasing mode control means corresponding to the condition. Thus, the charge and discharge conditions for gradually increasing the internal resistance of each of the batteries include, for example, a discharge condition for making the discharge current relatively large during discharging or a charge condition for making the charge current relatively small during charging.', 'Furthermore, according to another aspect, the present invention provides a battery system comprising: one or more lithium ion secondary batteries each having a power generating element and an electrolyte being impregnated in the power generating element and containing lithium ions; charge and discharge control means for controlling charging and discharging of each of the lithium ion secondary batteries; and internal resistance detecting means for performing at least one of detection and estimation about a level of internal resistance in at least one of the lithium ion secondary batteries; wherein the charge and discharge control means comprises: a plurality of mode control means for controlling charging and discharging each of the lithium ion secondary batteries on a predetermined charge and discharge condition, the mode control means including: first mode control means for controlling charging and discharging each of the lithium ion secondary batteries on a first charge and discharge condition; and second mode control means for controlling charging and discharging each of the lithium ion secondary batteries on a second charge and discharge condition different from the first charge and discharge condition; mode selecting means for selecting one mode control means to be used from the plurality of mode control means, wherein when a comparison is made between a case of discharging each of the lithium ion secondary batteries by the first mode control means and a case of discharging each of the lithium ion secondary batteries by the second mode control means, a discharge current by the second mode control means is made smaller on a predetermined discharge condition and equal to or smaller on other discharge conditions than a discharge current by the first mode control means, and the mode selecting means is configured: to select the second mode control means when the internal resistance detecting means detects or estimates that the internal resistance is relatively high; and to select the first mode control means when the internal resistance detecting means detects or estimates that the internal resistance is relatively low.', 'The battery system of the invention includes the lithium ion secondary battery, the charge and discharge control means, and the internal resistance detecting means. The charge and discharge control means includes the plurality of mode control means including the first mode control means and the second mode control means, and the mode selecting means. In the battery system of the invention, when the internal resistance of the battery(s) to be detected is detected or estimated to be relatively high, the charging and discharging by the second mode control means according to the second charge and discharge condition is selected. When each of the batteries is charged or discharged by the second mode control means, the discharge current flowing on the predetermined discharge condition of the second charge and discharge condition is made relatively small as compared to the case of the first mode control means according to the first charge and discharge condition. Even on other discharge conditions, the discharge current is made equal or smaller. Thus, the repeated charging and discharging of each of the batteries using the second mode control means can decrease the internal resistance to restore the degradation of each of the batteries.', 'Conversely, when the internal resistance of the battery(s) to be detected is detected or estimated to be relatively low, the first mode control means is selected. When the charging and discharging is performed by the first mode control means, the discharge current on the predetermined discharge condition is made relatively large as compared to the case of the second mode control means. Even on other discharge conditions, the discharge current is made equal or larger. Thus, the charging and discharging is repeatedly performed by selecting the first mode control means, which can prevent the internal resistance from excessively decreasing or can prevent the internal resistance from rather increasing due to continuous control by the second mode control means for decreasing the internal resistance.', 'Accordingly, appropriate means can be selected in use from the first mode control means and the second mode control means to constantly restrain the internal resistance of each of the batteries within the appropriate range.', 'The first mode control means and the second mode control means preferably have the same charge condition.', 'The first charge and discharge condition is preferably a charge and discharge condition in which the internal resistance of each of the batteries is gradually increased by repeatedly charging and discharging each of the batteries by the first mode control means corresponding to the condition.', 'Further, the second charge and discharge condition is preferably a charge and discharge condition in which the internal resistance of each of the batteries is gradually decreased by repeatedly charging and discharging each of the batteries by the second mode control means corresponding to the condition.', 'In the above battery system, preferably, the predetermined discharge condition is a discharge condition where a maximum discharge current available by the first mode control means flows.', 'In the battery system of the invention, when each of the batteries is discharged by the second mode control means on the predetermined discharge condition, that is, on the discharge condition where the maximum discharge current available by the first mode control means flows, the discharge current smaller than the maximum discharge current is allowed to flow through the system. That is, in the battery system of the invention, even on the discharge condition for allowing the maximum discharge current to flow through the system during discharging by the first mode control means, the second mode control means allows the discharge current smaller than the maximum current to flow through the system. Thus, when the charge and discharge control of each of the batteries is performed by the second mode control means, the magnitude of the discharge current is suppressed. The repeated charging and discharging using such second mode control means can suppress an increase in internal resistance of each of the batteries, and further gradually decrease the internal resistance, thereby restoring the degradation of each of the batteries. Conversely, the repeated charging and discharging using the first mode control means can increase the internal resistance of each of the batteries. That is, this arrangement can easily achieve the two mode control means whose changing tendencies of the internal resistance are reverse to each other.', 'In the above battery system, preferably, on any one of the predetermined discharge condition and said other discharge conditions, a discharge current by the second mode control means is made smaller than a discharge current by the first mode control means.', 'In the battery system of the invention, the discharge current by the second mode control means is smaller than that by the first mode control means on any one of the discharge conditions. The repeated charging and discharging using such second mode control means can surely suppress the increase in internal resistance of each of the batteries, and further gradually decrease the internal resistance, thereby restoring the degradation of each of the batteries. Conversely, the repeated charging and discharging using the first mode control means can gradually increase the internal resistance of each of the batteries. That is, this arrangement can easily achieve the two mode control means whose changing tendencies of the internal resistance are reverse to each other.",0

"As described above, in 3GPP Release 12, radio resources for sidelink transmission are scheduled per sidelink control period (i.e., PSCCH period). That is, a sidelink transmitting terminal transmits scheduling assignment information (i.e., SCI format 0) indicating sidelink transmission resources to a receiving terminal every sidelink control period (i.e., PSCCH period). Accordingly, the transmitting terminal has to accept a delay depending on the length of the sidelink control period from when data to be transmitted on the sidelink occurs to when the transmitting terminal transmits this data. Even when the length of the sidelink control period is the shortest length of 40 ms, a transmission delay could be up to about 35 ms.

"The thin film encapsulation structure described in each of Patent Documents No. 1, 2 and 3 does not include a thick organic barrier layer, and therefore, is considered to improve the bendability of the OLED display device. In addition, since the inorganic barrier layer and the organic barrier layer may be formed continuously, the mass-productivity is also improved.', 'However, according to the studies made by the present inventor, an organic barrier layer formed by the method described in Patent Document No. 2 or 3 has a problem of not providing a sufficiently high level of moisture-resistance reliability.', 'In the case where an organic barrier layer is formed by use of a printing method such as an inkjet method or the like, it is possible to form the organic barrier layer only in an active region on the element substrate (the active region may also be referred to as an “element formation region” or a “display region”) but not in a region other than the active region. In this case, in the vicinity of the active region (outer to the active region), there is a region where the first inorganic material layer and the second inorganic material layer are in direct contact with each other, and the organic barrier layer is fully enclosed by the first inorganic material layer and the second inorganic material layer and is insulated from the outside of the first inorganic material layer and the second inorganic material layer.', 'By contrast, according to the method for forming the organic barrier layer described in Patent Document No. 2 or 3, a resin (organic resin) is supplied onto the entire surface of the element substrate, and the surface tension of the liquid-state resin is used to locate the resin locally, more specifically, at the border between the surface of the element substrate and the side surface of the protruding portion on the surface of the element substrate. Therefore, the organic barrier layer may also be undesirably formed in a region other than the active region (the region other than the active region may also be referred to as a “peripheral region”), namely, a terminal region where a plurality of terminals are located and a lead wire region where lead wires extending from the active region to the terminal region are formed. Specifically, the resin is present locally, more specifically, at, for example, the border between side surfaces of the lead wires or side surfaces of the terminals and the surface of the substrate. In this case, an end of the organic barrier layer formed along the lead wires is not enclosed by the first inorganic barrier layer or the second inorganic barrier layer, but is exposed to the air (ambient atmosphere).', 'The organic barrier layer is lower in the water vapor barrier property than the inorganic barrier layer. Therefore, the organic barrier layer formed along the lead wires acts as a route that leads the water vapor in the air to the active region.', 'The problem of the thin film encapsulation structure in an organic EL display device including a flexible substrate is described above.

"In recent years, in order to reduce manufacturing costs, steel manufacturers have been shifting the method used for manufacturing steel plate from the ingot-making to continuous casting. When a steel plate manufactured by continuous casting is welded by an electron beam, the toughness of the weld tends to deteriorate. Accordingly, a problem arises in that with normal welding and heat treatment, the tolerance associated with achieving the desired joint performance tends to decrease.', 'In welding of a low-alloy steel or similar steel material using an electron beam, the amount of heat input into the base material must be increased as the thickness of the structure is increased. However, the toughness of the weld tends to decrease as the amount of heat input into the base material is increased. As a result, a problem exists in that for a joint in a thick-plate structure, satisfactory restoration of the toughness of the weld cannot be expected simply by performing a post weld heat treatment. For example, when a base material having a plate thickness of 100 mm is processed with a single pass, the joint performance satisfies the required values. On the other hand, when a base material having a plate thickness of 120 mm is processed with a single pass, the tolerance associated with achieving the required values for the weld toughness tends to decrease, and therefore in order to satisfy quality requirements, a further technique must be used to improve the toughness.', 'In order to address the above problems, methods have been proposed that improve the toughness of the weld by altering the chemical composition of the weld via a technique such as the addition of a filler material having an appropriate chemical component to the welded metal of the weld. However, when butt welding of thick plates is conducted by electron beam welding, welding using an added filler cannot be performed.', 'Furthermore, in electron beam welding, because the weld bead is prone to deflections caused by fine magnetism, weld defects caused by misalignment tend to occur readily. This misalignment becomes more likely as the plate thickness increases. The weld bead can be widened to prevent misalignment, but increasing the width of the weld bead requires a high heat input, resulting in a deterioration in the performance such as the toughness of the weld.', 'The present invention has been developed in light of the above circumstances, and has an object of providing an electron beam welding method capable of restoring toughness, even to a weld formed with a high heat input in order to prevent misalignment.",2

"In the above-mentioned scanning near-field optical microscope, the near-field light generated between a measurement probe and a sample to be inspected interacts with the measurement probe to generate scattered light (transmission light) and the scattered light is detected to obtain a near-field light image effectively. An optical lever detection system is used to control the measurement probe and the back of a cantilever in which the measurement probe is mounted is irradiated with laser light, so that contact force between the measurement probe and the sample is read from change in the position of reflected light thereof. However, in the above-mentioned scanning near-field optical microscope, the following problems arise in measurement in liquid of cell, molecule or the like of an organism. In other words, when the scattered light penetrates a wall surface of a plane surface of a transparent sample cell which is filled with liquid and in which the sample such as cell, molecule or the like of the organism is held, spherical aberration occurs so that the scattered light cannot be focused on a point and it is difficult to receive the light by a photoelectric conversion element efficiently, so that a detection signal of the scattered light is reduced greatly and the SN ratio and the measurement reproducibility of the near-field light image are reduced. Further, most of the scattered light incident on the interface between the atmosphere and the liquid without penetrating the wall surface of the sample cell cannot be focused due to the total reflection on the interface, so that the SN ratio and the measurement reproducibility of the near-field light image are also reduced similarly. Moreover, when the laser light of the optical lever detection system penetrates the interface between the atmosphere and the liquid, the position of the laser light is varied due to minute fluctuation of the liquid surface and contact force between the measurement probe and the sample is varied to generate fluctuation in the detection signal of the scattered light, so that the SN ratio and the measurement reproducibility of the near-field light image are also reduced similarly. In the same way, when the laser light for generating the near-field light penetrates the interface between the atmosphere and the liquid, the position of the laser light is varied, so that the intensity of the near-field light generated is varied and the SN ratio and the measurement reproducibility of the near-field light image are reduced.', 'Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to increase the detection light amount of near-field light generated in a liquid between a measurement probe and a sample to be inspected at the time of employing a scanning near-field optical microscope for measurement in the liquid and improve the SN ratio and the measurement reproducibility of a near-field light image.",2

However, since good feedforward control or the like is not executed as described above, the motor does not operate according to the command value, and the elastic deformation compensation does not sufficiently function.', 'Also, PTL 2 discloses the method of making the interference between the respective axes to be non-interference. However, with this method, the first-order differential value and the second-order differential value of the arm acceleration are required, and this method is extremely weak for noise. Also, even if a slightly rapid operation is made, the second-order differential value of the arm acceleration provides an astronomical value. This method has extremely large restriction when the method is realized.', 'That is, with the related art, the following problems are not addressed.', '(1) The elastic deformation compensation or the axial force torque compensation cannot be effectively provided in a state in which the natural oscillation of the robot is low. Hence, the influence of elastic deformation cannot be compensated, resulting in deterioration in accuracy.', '(2) The elastic deformation compensation control cannot be effectively provided in a state in which the phase delay of the servo controller is present. Hence, the influence of elastic deformation cannot be compensated, resulting in deterioration in accuracy.', '(3) The servo control characteristic is different depending on each axis. Hence, a difference is generated in the response of each axis, resulting in deterioration in trajectory accuracy.', '(4) The phase difference that is generated if the calculation period of the command value is later than the calculation period of the servo controller results in deterioration in trajectory accuracy.', '(5) In a weaving operation of the welding robot, it is very important to align the phase delay and gain characteristic with the weaving period. However, it is very difficult to align the phase and gain characteristic for the high-frequency weaving operation because of a change in servo characteristic resulted from the elastic deformation due to the reduction gear, and a difference in characteristic depending on each axis.', 'The present invention is made in light of the above-described problems. An object of the present invention is to provide, in an articulated robot including a plurality of axes, an elastic-deformation-compensation control device and a control method for an articulated robot, each of which can compensate an influence of elastic deformation of each axis and which enables an operation such as weaving with high trajectory accuracy.",2

"In the LN modulator 300 shown in FIG. 12, the minimum value of the intensity of light outputted from the first optical output port 30 or the second optical output port 31 is completely zero, provided that lights inputted to the optical coupler 8 from the two optical waveguides 4 and 5 are coupled under the state where the ratio of the intensities of the lights is exactly equal. That is, in this case, an extinction ratio (an on/off ratio of a light signal) of the lights has an infinite value.', 'Actually, however, sometimes, the extinction ratio of the light outputted from the optical waveguide does not have the infinite value but has a finite value. Reasons for this will be described below.', 'A first reason is that, sometimes, a division ratio regarding the light intensities of lights outputted from the optical division circuit 3 is not strictly equal because of a manufacturing error and wavelength dependency with respect to the optical waveguide.', 'A second reason is that bias voltages applied to the first optical waveguide 4 and the optical waveguide 5 are different from each other when phase modulation is performed, so that optical waveguide losses of the first optical waveguide 4 and the second optical waveguide 5 are also different from each other. That is, in general, when phase modulation is performed, bias voltages each applied to the first phase modulator 17 and the second phase modulator 27 are different from each other. Thus, a difference arises between the losses caused by the first optical waveguide 4 and the second optical waveguide 5. Incidentally, because of a variation over time regarding the characteristics of each of the optical waveguides, sometimes, the losses caused by the first optical waveguide 4 and the second optical waveguide 5 gradually become different from each other.', 'Moreover, in addition to the first and second reasons described above, there is given a third reason that, because of a manufacturing error between the first and second optical waveguides, misalignment arises in the ratio of the light intensity of light having transmitted through the first optical waveguide 4 and the light intensity of light having transmitted through the second optical waveguide 5.', 'Because of the asymmetric properties regarding the inputs to the optical coupler 8 in the first to third reasons described above, the extinction ratios of lights outputted from the first optical output port 30 and the second optical output port 31 are likely to degrade.', 'The degradation of the optical extinction ratio leads to deterioration of the transmission characteristics of light. Thus, it is desirable that, during operation of the optical modulator, the extinction ratio of each of lights outputted from the optical coupler 8 can be improved by monitoring lights each transmitting through the optical waveguides and feeding back monitored situations of the lights to a driving circuit for the phase modulators.', 'It is possible to adjust a loss difference between the loss caused by the first optical waveguide 4 and the loss caused by the second optical waveguide 5 by adjusting voltages applied to the electrodes provided on the optical waveguides. Nevertheless, even if a desired loss difference has been realized, simultaneously, a not intended phase difference arises between the lights transmitting through the both optical waveguides because of the characteristics of a semiconductor material. As a result, for a general optical modulator, there has been a problem that the adjustment of the bias voltages results in a degradation of the modulation characteristics of the Mach-Zehnder type optical modulator.', 'Further, in PTL5, there is disclosed a configuration in which, besides the Mach-Zehnder interferometer for modulation, another Mach-Zehnder interferometer for a light intensity adjustment is provided and lights divided at the stage anterior to the optical coupler are monitored. In the configuration disclosed in PTL5, the light intensities are adjusted by causing a PD to monitor each of the divided lights and performing feedback control. Nevertheless, in an optical modulator composed of a semiconductor material, applying a voltage to an electrode provided on the optical waveguide causes simultaneous variations of the phase and the loss of light. Accordingly, it is difficult to adjust only the loss merely by employing such a Mach-Zehnder interferometer for a light intensity modulation as described in PTL5. In addition, since the optical modulator described in PTL5 includes the Mach-Zehnder interferometer for a light intensity modulation, there is also a problem that configuration of the optical modulator is complicated.', 'Meanwhile, in each of the technologies described in PTL1 to PTL4, there is not disclosed a configuration which makes it possible to, in a simple and easy configuration, independently perform control of a phase difference and losses of lights each transmitting through a corresponding one of the two optical waveguides each composed of a semiconductor material.",2

"However, in the case where a plurality of semiconductor laser devices are used as excitation light sources in the laser ignition device so as to increase the output energy, thereby performing ignition of an internal combustion engine having low ignitability, when an optical isolator is used, as in the conventional technique, to prevent the semiconductor laser element being broken due to returned light, following problems arise.', 'Firstly, various optical components which compose the optical isolator are required so that manufacturing cost may increase.', 'Secondary, it is necessary to adjust an optical axis of the excitation light oscillated by the plurality of semiconductor laser elements to be received by the optical isolator. Hence, a mechanism or a work for adjusting the optical axis is further required, which causes a further increase of manufacturing cost.', 'In the laser ignition devices, a pulse laser having extremely large energy density has to be condensed. Accordingly, a semiconductor laser module composed of a plurality of semiconductor laser elements is used as an excitation light source, whereby loads of each of the semiconductor laser elements can be reduced.', 'In this case, when the excitation light oscillated by the plurality of semiconductor laser elements is condensed by a condenser lens, excitation light having mutually different phases are present, and each of the optical axes are different from each other. Hence, in the case where a beam of the excitation light which passed through the optical isolator are recombined similar to the beam of the original excitation light, and the returned light is emitted to the light source side, it is very difficult to adjust the ordinary light and the extraordinary light separated by the plurality of semiconductor laser elements so that they do not enter the semiconductor laser elements.', 'Thirdly, in the case where the optical isolator is used, intensity of the excitation light being irradiated to the laser medium may be decreased, because of a reflection loss when the excitation light enters the optical isolator and a transmission loss of optical components which compose the optical isolator.', 'Other than the optical isolator, since transmission loss occurs when passing through the optical components, which is not avoidable, a simple configuration is preferably used where the number of optical components is reduced as much as possible to increase an energy efficiency of the laser ignition device.', 'Fourthly, since the optical isolator produces Faraday effects by using a permanent magnet which applies a strong magnetic field to a Faraday rotator, a mechanism that cuts off magnetic field is required in the vicinity thereof, causing an increase in size of the laser ignition device. Therefore, recent requirements of shrinking laser ignition device may not be satisfied.', 'Fifthly, conventionally, it has been considered that almost no laser light leakage exists from an edge surface of excitation side of the laser resonator. However, in the case where the laser ignition requires a laser for generating a megawatt order or more of giant pulse, it has been found that light leakage from the edge surface of the excitation side cannot be ignored.', 'Specifically, the excitation edge surface of the microchip laser serves as a totally reflecting mirror of the resonator as well. Hence, conventionally, a transmittance of 0.1% is considered sufficient for the oscillation light, as a transmittance of the high reflection coating.', 'However, considering that the optical power in the resonator of the laser oscillation is 10 MW or more, even when the transmittance of the high reflection coating is 0.1%, the optical power of light leakage transmitted from the edge surface reaches 10 KW.', 'On the other hand, the optical power required for the excitation light of such a microchip laser is approximately 100 W, which is only 1/100 of the optical power of the light leakage of the oscillation light, even when 100% amount of the excitation light is returned.', 'Specifically, the light leakage of the oscillated light from the resonator, as a conventional problem of the semiconductor laser, is much larger than the returned light due to a reflection from the excitation light. Hence, there is a concern that the light leakage of the oscillated light from the resonator may directly hit the semiconductor laser device used for an excitation light source.', 'The semiconductor laser element is irradiated by the oscillated light leakage for extremely short period of time such as several nanoseconds. However, it was found that long-term reliability is degraded. Note that the duration where the excitation reflection light irradiates the semiconductor laser element is extremely larger than the duration where the oscillation light leakage from the laser resonator side irradiates the semiconductor laser element. In this respect, an amount of energy of the excitation reflection light is larger than that of the oscillation light leakage. However, since the electric power the excitation reflection light is small, the laser diode does not suffer any damage. However, the oscillation light leakage of which the electric power is extremely high causes a damage to the laser diode even in a very short period of time.', 'It should be noted that damage to the semiconductor laser element is caused by thermal reasons or light intensity (power/area) reasons. The present invention is to solve a failure caused by an increase in the power of the oscillated light leakage, the oscillated light leakage being among the light returning to the excitation light source side.', 'The present invention has been achieved in light of the above-mentioned circumstances and aims to provide a laser ignition device capable of preventing semiconductor laser element being deteriorated so as to accomplish stable ignition operation, by suppressing the intensity of light leakage towards the semiconductor laser device from the laser resonator with a simple configuration.",2

"However, conventional sun tracking sensors using a light position sensor made up of a quadrant photodiode or single element or the like have a problem that an error of ±0.01° or above occurs with respect to an optical axis of light actually emitted from the sun. For example, a tracking type photovoltaic power system is known which drives a solar panel using information outputted from a sun tracking sensor, for example, so that the solar panel is always oriented toward a direction orthogonal to the sunlight. For such a tracking type photovoltaic power system, a condensing type solar panel is used in recent years in order to improve power generation efficiency. In the case of a condensing type solar panel, since light is condensed using a Fresnel lens, errors of ±0.1° due to the sun tracking sensor are added up, preventing light emitted from the sun from being accurately radiated onto solar cells and causing conversion efficiency to deteriorate. Furthermore, light condensed by the Fresnel lens may be condensed at a position different from the solar battery cell, causing damage to the device due to an abnormal temperature rise. In this way, there is a demand for further improvement of accuracy with which the position of the sun is detected in recent years.', 'Furthermore, when the sun is hidden behind clouds, the quantity of light emitted from the sun decreases depending on how the sun is hidden, and the conventional sun tracking sensor has a problem that it cannot detect the position of the sun. Moreover, although it is possible to detect the position of the sun to a certain extent depending on how the sun is hidden, light emitted from the sun is scattered by clouds and the light quantity is also detected from parts other than the sun.

"As explained above, in the prior art, the pores of the support carbon material were designed focusing on the diffusion of the reaction gas of the oxygen gas (PLTs 1 to 3). Further, the catalyst layers were designed focusing on the suppression of the flooding phenomenon (PLT 4). In both cases, however, the flooding phenomenon occurring in the support carbon material could not necessarily be sufficiently suppressed. Issues remained such as that at the time of large current power generation under high humidity conditions, the rate of utilization of the catalyst metal supported at the support carbon material fell and sufficient power generation performance could not be achieved.', 'Therefore, the inventors studied in detail the mechanism due to which the flooding phenomenon occurs at the time of large current power generation under high humidity conditions in the operating conditions of a solid polymer type fuel cell and came to believe as follows. First, the flooding phenomenon occurs at the cathode side catalyst layer where water is generated in the power generation reaction and is the following such phenomenon. At this cathode side catalyst layer, the water molecules generated due to the reaction 2 of the catalyst reactions disassociate from the surface of the catalyst metal in the gaseous state, diffuse in the catalyst layer driven by the gradient in concentration, pass through the flow paths of oxygen gas (in practice, air) of the separator arranged at the cathode, and are discharged out of the system, but at this time, the water molecules liquefy in the catalyst layer. The condensed water produced due to this closes the gas diffusion paths of oxygen gas.', 'Here, the paths of diffusion of water molecules in the catalyst layer are roughly divided into intraparticle pores present inside the particles of the support carbon material and interparticle pores formed between particles of the support carbon material outside the support carbon material. The former are fine pores of several nm or less which a support carbon material comprised of a porous carbon material has inside the material. Particulates of the catalyst metal (platinum particulates) are supported inside the intraparticle pores and perform an important function when the reaction 2 of the catalyst reactions is performed in a catalyst layer. On the other hand, the latter interparticle pores are mainly formed due to the size of the support carbon material and its dendritic structures. In general, the size of the interparticle pores in the catalyst layer becomes the same extent as the typical size scale of the support carbon material. A current representative support carbon material is Ketjenblack (made by Lion). The primary particles forming the dendritic structures are about 40 nm. The average size of the dendritic structures is about 100 nm, so the interparticle pores formed in the catalyst layer are several tens of nm to 100 nm or so.', 'Further, to suppress the flooding phenomenon, the inventors considered it important to control the former pores present inside the support carbon material. Specifically, the pore size, pore length, hydrophilicity of the pore walls, etc. are controlled. When the pore size becomes a size of an extent of several water molecules, the Van de Waals force (attraction) between the wall surfaces and water molecules causes the pressure causing condensation (liquefaction) (density of water molecules) to fall. As a result, if the current density rises, first, the pores of this size start to be closed. Further, if the hydrophilicity of the wall surfaces forming the pores is high, the water molecules are adsorbed at the wall surfaces and the substantive pore sizes decrease. Further, since the water molecules form the wall surfaces, the pressure for condensation falls, that is, it becomes easier for water to be condensed by a large current. Further, in the catalyst layer, near the ionomer resin or hydrophilic support carbon material, an environment conducive to condensation of the water molecules is formed, so the flooding phenomenon occurs more easily.', 'Therefore, from the entirely new viewpoint of suppressing the flooding phenomenon which occurs inside a support carbon material, which was never studied in the past, the present inventors studied intensively the pore structure inside the support carbon material for the purpose of improving the power generation characteristics at the time of large current power generation, in particular improving the power generation characteristics at the time of large current power generation under high humidity conditions. In that process, they learned the following facts and thereby completed the present invention. That is, they discovered that to make the particulates of the catalyst metal supported inside the particles of the support carbon material sufficiently participate in the reactions under conditions where the flooding phenomenon easily occurs such as at the time of large current power generation under high humidity conditions, it is possible to form intraparticle pores (catalyst support pores) required for supporting the particulates of the catalyst metal inside the particles of this support carbon material and simultaneously form pores of a size of the same extent as the conventional interparticle pores in the catalyst layer required for gas diffusion (gas diffusion pores) and thereby suppress to a maximum extent the flooding phenomenon which occurred in the fine pores inside the support carbon material up to now and enable almost all of the catalyst metal particulates supported inside the support carbon material to participate in the catalyst reaction and thereby completed the present invention.', 'Therefore, based on the above basic guidelines, an object of the present invention is to provide a support carbon material able to support a catalyst metal in a highly dispersed state, resistant to the flooding phenomenon even at the time of large current power generation under high humidity conditions, and with little drop in voltage at the time of large current power generation and to provide a catalyst using the same.",2

"However, in the above-described conventional control system, when the state of the wheels driven/braked by the motor is switched, the command torque output to the motor is held at 0 for the predetermined time period, which prevents the torque of the motor from being transmitted to the wheels, and hence it is impossible to sufficiently exhibit responsiveness of the motor, which may have adversely affect the drivability.', 'Further, when the state of the wheels driven/braked by the motor is switched, mechanical connection between the motor and the wheels is released until the above-mentioned backlash clogging is eliminated, so that the rotational speeds of the motor and the wheels are temporarily fluctuated. Therefore, for example, in a case where excessive slip in the wheels is determined by comparing the rotational speed of the motor or the wheels with the threshold value, if the changed rotational speed of the motor or the wheels reaches the threshold value, it may be erroneously determined that excessive slip has occurred even though excessive slip has not actually occurred in the wheels.', 'The present invention has been made to provide a solution to the above-described problems, and an object thereof is to provide a slip determination system for a vehicle, which is capable of improving the accuracy of excessive slip determination by avoiding erroneous determination of excessive slip in a wheel when the state of the wheel driven/braked by a motor is switched.",2
"According to the window screen with a blind function of the present invention described in detail thus far in which the both ends of a number of the slats for dimming or light-shielding are attached between the first screen and the second screen, which are wound upward by the winding shaft, are attached to the respective screens at regular intervals so as to be freely tiltable, and the slats are wound around the winding shaft together with the above-described both screens in an overlapped manner, either one of the bottom bars attached individually to lower ends of the above-described both screens, wherein one of the bottom bars are configured to come into stably and constantly contact with the lower frame of the screen frame irrespective of the posture of inclination of the above-described slats, so that destabilization of posture due to wind or the like, disfigurement due to a gap formed between the bottom bar and the above-described lower frame, and formation of an insect entrance route by the gap are suppressed.

"The first feature of the plant cultivation container according to the present invention lies in that the plant cultivation container includes: a water reservoir portion for pooling plant cultivation water, the water reservoir portion having a bed material accommodation part for placing a water-absorbing plant cultivation bed material, wherein the water reservoir portion is provided with a surrounding feed-water channel that surrounds an entire circumference of the bed material accommodation part, and a feed-discharge channel for supplying the plant cultivation water from outside to the water reservoir portion and for discharging the plant cultivation water in the water reservoir portion to outside is provided in communication with the surrounding feed-water channel.', 'In the plant cultivation container according to the first feature of the present invention, the plant cultivation water from outside immediately reaches the bed material accommodation part of the water reservoir portion through the feed-discharge channel, and there is no need to provide a special feed-water tube made of a porous material. In addition, the plant cultivation water supplied through the feed-discharge channel continuously enters the surrounding feed-water channel that surrounds the entire circumference of the bed material accommodation part, and thus effects can be obtained in that, the entire circumference of the plant cultivation bed material is surrounded with the plant cultivation water in a relatively short time period from the beginning of the plant cultivation water supply, and most of or necessary portions of the plant cultivation bed materials can be satisfactorily permeated in a relatively short time period. It should be noted that, the plant cultivation container according to the present invention can be also used by connecting a plurality of the plant cultivation containers to one another, and in this case, the plant cultivation water supplied at a speed above a water absorption speed of the plant cultivation bed material is supplied through the feed-discharge channel to the downstream plant cultivation container.', 'Another feature of the present invention lies in that the surrounding feed-water channel is provided with a first weir member for controlling a circulation direction of the plant cultivation water.', 'With this configuration, the plant cultivation water which tends to flow into in one circulation direction is dammed up by the first weir member, and the plant cultivation water tends to enter the surrounding feed-water channel in the other circulation direction. Therefore, the entire circumference of a lower end portion of the plant cultivation bed material tends to be rapidly surrounded with the plant cultivation water. As a result, most of the plant cultivation bed materials can be appropriately moistened in a shorter period of time.', 'Another feature of the present invention lies in that the feed-discharge channel is in a shape of a groove disposed adjacent to one side of the water reservoir portion.', 'With this configuration, a condition of the plant cultivation water introduced through the feed-discharge channel can be observed and visually checked through flowers, leaves or the like of the flowering plants, on lateral sides of the plant cultivation bed material, without being hidden under the plant cultivation bed material. In other words, it can be visually determined whether or not the plant cultivation water is appropriately supplied, whether or not the plant cultivation water leaks between the connected plant cultivation containers, whether or not the plant cultivation water discharged from the plant cultivation container is abnormally contaminated, and the like. As a result, management of the plants is facilitated.', 'Another feature of the present invention lies in that the plant cultivation container further includes: a second weir member for dividing the feed-discharge channel into a first channel on an upstream side and a second channel on a downstream side in a water flow direction; and a partition wall for partitioning the feed-discharge channel and the water reservoir portion, wherein in the partition wall, a first opening for allowing the first channel of the feed-discharge channel to communicate with an upstream side of the surrounding feed-water channel and a second opening for allowing the second channel of the feed-discharge channel to communicate with a downstream side of the surrounding feed-water channel are formed at a distance from each other.', 'With this configuration, the plant cultivation water supplied to the feed-discharge channel enters the upstream side of the surrounding feed-water channel from the feed-discharge channel on the upstream side, circulates around the plant cultivation bed material, reaches the downstream side of the surrounding feed-water channel, and then returns to the feed-discharge channel on the downstream side. In this manner, since the entire circumference of the lower end portion of the plant cultivation bed material is rapidly surrounded with the plant cultivation water, most of the plant cultivation bed materials are moistened in a shorter period of time. In addition, after the plant cultivation bed material reached a steady state in which it is satisfactorily moistened, the entire plant cultivation water supplied thereafter does not directly flow out to the downstream plant cultivation container but enters the surrounding feed-water channel. Therefore the replacement of the plant cultivation water in the water reservoir portion with fresh water is facilitated.', 'Another feature of the present invention lies in that the water reservoir portion is formed of two water reservoir portions arranged side by side so that the water reservoir portions are opposed across the feed-discharge channel.', 'With this configuration, the feed-discharge channel runs between two water reservoir portions arranged side by side and therefore, when the planted flowering plants have grown up to fully cover the range, the feed-discharge channel can be seen only between the flowering plants planted in at least two of the plant cultivation bed materials. Therefore, an appearance of the flower bed formed of the plant cultivation containers that have received the flowering plants is further improved.', 'Another feature of the present invention lies in that a plurality of the water reservoir portions are arranged adjacent to each other along the feed-discharge channel, and between the adjacent water reservoir portions, a third weir member for pooling the plant cultivation water is provided.', 'With this configuration, even if the plant cultivation container is placed on a part of an inclined floor face, such as a rooftop of a building, there can be suppressed a tendency of the supplied plant cultivation water to flow toward the water reservoir portion on a lower side positioned downstream of the feed-discharge channel due to an own weight of the plant cultivation water, and the entire circumference of the lower end portion of the plant cultivation bed material on the upstream side can be rapidly surrounded with the plant cultivation water. Therefore, the plant cultivation bed materials placed in each of the upstream and downstream water reservoir portions can be appropriately moistened uniformly and efficiently.', 'Another feature of the present invention lies in that the plant cultivation container further includes: a second weir member for dividing the feed-discharge channel into a first channel on an upstream side and a second channel on a downstream side in a water flow direction; and a partition wall for partitioning the feed-discharge channel and the water reservoir portion, wherein in the partition wall, a first opening for allowing the first channel of the feed-discharge channel to communicate with the water reservoir portion on the upstream side and a second opening for allowing the second channel of the feed-discharge channel to communicate with the surrounding feed-water channel on the downstream side are formed.', 'With this configuration, in the case where a plurality of the water reservoir portions are arranged adjacent to each other and along the feed-discharge channel, the plant cultivation water supplied to the feed-discharge channel first enters the surrounding feed-water channel of the upstream water reservoir portion from the feed-discharge channel on the upstream side, circulates around the plant cultivation bed material, enters the surrounding feed-water channel of the upstream water reservoir portion, again circulates around the plant cultivation bed material, and then returns to the feed-discharge channel on the downstream side. In this manner, since the entire circumference of the lower end portion of the plant cultivation bed material on each of the upstream and downstream sides is rapidly surrounded with the plant cultivation water, most of the plant cultivation bed materials are moistened in a shorter period of time. In addition, after the plant cultivation bed material reached a steady state in which it is satisfactorily moistened, the entire plant cultivation water supplied thereafter does not directly flow out to the downstream plant cultivation container but enters the surrounding feed-water channel of each water reservoir portion. Therefore the replacement of the plant cultivation water in the water reservoir portion with fresh water is facilitated.', 'Another feature of the present invention lies in that the plant cultivation container further includes an engaging portion for additionally and removably attaching an auxiliary weir at a position adjacent to the third weir member on an upstream side or downstream side thereof.', 'With this configuration, the auxiliary weir is additionally attached in accordance with a degree of a slope of the floor face where the plant cultivation container is placed (with the proviso that the height is above a height of the third weir member), and even when the degree of the slope of the floor face is large, an appropriate water feed function can be attained.', 'Another feature of the present invention lies in that a weir member for pooling the plant cultivation water in the water reservoir portion on the downstream side is provided between the second opening and the second channel.', 'With this configuration, when the plant cultivation container is placed on the floor face with a relatively steep slope, a deficiency of the pooled water in the downstream water reservoir container as compared with the upstream water reservoir container is suppressed, and thus the water feed state between the upstream water reservoir container and the downstream water reservoir container becomes more uniform, and thus uniformalization of growth conditions of the plants is facilitated.",0

"The object of the present invention can be achieved by providing a refrigerator including a cabinet defining a first storage region for storing food, a door for opening and closing the first storage region, a gasket which is provided on an inner surface of the door and seals the first storage region from outdoor air by forming a sealing boundary when the door closes the first storage region, a first hinge member which has a rotary shaft and rotatably connects the door to the cabinet out of the sealing boundary, a container which defines a second storage region for storing food and is received in the first storage region, and a second hinge member which is fixed, at one side thereof, to the container within the sealing boundary while being rotatably connected, at the other side thereof, to the door, the second hinge member having a rotary shaft which is vertically and linearly aligned with the rotary shaft of the first hinge member.', 'The second hinge member may be located within the sealing boundary. Accordingly, since the second hinge member is located within the sealing boundary formed through the gasket, the first and second storage regions may be simultaneously sealed through one sealing boundary.', 'In order for the container (auxiliary storage region) to be rotated relative to the door of the refrigerator, the second hinge member may include a fixed portion fixed to the container, a rotation portion which is rotatably connected to the door, and a connection portion connecting the rotation portion to the fixed portion. The rotation portion may be provided with a rotary shaft of the second hinge member.', 'The connection portion may be configured to directly connect the rotation portion and the fixed portion. That is, a separate mechanical coupling for pivot coupling between the rotation portion and the fixed portion may be excluded. Thus, the second hinge member may be configured of one rigid body having a single body.', 'In the embodiment of the present invention, the gasket is provided so as to be pressed against a front surface of the cabinet inside the door of the refrigerator. Accordingly, the sealing boundary, which is a boundary of a maintenance region of cold air by the gasket, is formed. The connection portion is preferably formed to be bypassed into the sealing boundary without being connected from the rotation portion to the fixed portion through a linear path. That is, the connection portion preferably extends from the rotation portion to the fixed portion by being bypassed into the sealing boundary. As an example of such a connection portion, bypassing of the connection portion may be realized by giving a curvature or providing a bent shape to the connection portion.', 'A horizontally spaced distance from the rotation portion to a specific portion of the connection portion is preferably longer than a horizontally spaced distance from the rotation portion to the fixed portion. The specific portion may be formed by the bent shape. Due to such a difference between the horizontally spaced distances, interference between the door and the second hinge member may be prevented or minimized when the container rotates relative to the door. Particularly, it may be possible to prevent or minimize interference between the second hinge member and the gasket provided in the door.', 'The connection portion may include a first extension portion extending forward of the door from the rotation portion, a second extension portion extending forward of the door from the fixed portion, and a third extension portion connecting the first extension portion to the second extension portion.', 'The first extension portion may be inclined toward the second extension portion, and the second extension portion may include a curved portion formed outside a rotation trajectory of the gasket along with rotation of the door in a stationary state of the second hinge member. Accordingly, since the interference between the second hinge member and the gasket is excluded, it may be possible to prevent damage of the gasket and the door and the container may be rotated independently of each other.', 'The door is preferably provided with a receiving portion which has a receiving space receiving a portion of the connection portion and the rotation portion. The receiving portion may be formed within the door and may be recessed inward of the door from the inner surface thereof. Specifically, the receiving portion is preferably formed such that a portion of the connection portion and the rotation portion of the second hinge member is received in and rotatably supported by the receiving portion and a portion of the inside surface of the door in an inside region of the sealing boundary is recessed in a thickness direction of the door.', 'The receiving portion may extend from the inside of the sealing boundary to the outside thereof within the door.', 'In accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the rotary shaft of the second hinge member is formed in the receiving portion. In this case, the rotary shaft may be formed outside the sealing boundary of the receiving portion.', 'The door is preferably formed with an opening portion through which a portion of the connection portion enters from the receiving portion along with rotation of the door relative to the container. Accordingly, the opening portion may be an opening portion of the second hinge member receiving portion.', 'The opening portion is preferably located inside the sealing boundary. The receiving portion is preferably enclosed by a thermal insulator within the door. Accordingly, even when cold air is introduced into the receiving portion through the opening portion, it may be possible to prevent a leakage of cold air to the outside. Due to a position and coupling relation between the opening portion, the sealing boundary, and the receiving portion, a bent portion formed by the first, second, and third extension portions of the connection portion of the second hinge member may be received in the receiving portion.', 'The opening portion is preferably provided with an opening and closing member for selectively opening and closing the opening portion. That is, it is preferable to provide the opening and closing member for allowing the second hinge member to enter and exit the receiving portion through the opening portion and for preventing the opening portion from being fully opened to the outside. Particularly, the opening and closing member is preferably provided to close at least a portion of the opening portion in an opened state of the door so as to prevent foreign matters from being introduced into the receiving portion through the opening portion.', 'It is preferable to maintain a state in which the container is received in the first storage region, when the door rotates in the state in which the container is received in the first storage region. Even when the refrigerator door is fully opened, the container may also be maintained in the state of being received in the first storage region. However, to this end, an inner space of the second hinge member receiving portion formed in the door, namely the receiving space has to be elongated in a central direction of the door. Accordingly, interference with a storage space such as a basket may be generated within the refrigerator door. Therefore, the container is preferably received in the first storage region only until the interference is generated between the opening portion and the second hinge member when an opening angle of the refrigerator door reaches a certain level.', 'To this end, the embodiment of the present invention allows the second hinge member to interfere with one side of the opening portion of the receiving portion when the opening angle of the refrigerator door reaches a proper level. When the refrigerator door is further opened, the second hinge member interferes with the opening portion of the receiving portion so that the container may rotate by being decoupled from the first storage space. In this case, the refrigerator may further include a clearance maintaining portion formed to enclose the gasket so as not to damage the gasket of the door and the door by interference between the second hinge member and the door.', 'The clearance maintaining portion may be provided between the second hinge member and the gasket at one side of the opening portion. The clearance maintaining portion may be made of an elastic material. Accordingly, the clearance maintaining portion may be elastically deformed during generation of the interference between the opening portion and the second hinge member.', 'The embodiment of the present invention provides the refrigerator in which the first hinge member is located outside the sealing boundary and the second hinge member of the container (auxiliary storage region) is provided in the door. In this case, considerations are as follows.', 'First, in repeated operations of a state in which the container is decoupled from the first storage region and opened and a state in which the container is received in the first storage region, it is the fact that the container may rotate in the same direction as the door without interference with the door or the cabinet.', 'Secondarily, it is the fact that the container may also be opened independently of the door or may also be simultaneously opened together with the door.",0

"However, in the battery modules described in Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2, when excessive heat is generated in one battery to allow the operation of the safety valve, it is not possible to control the amount of the heat generated in the battery, or the influence of ignition of emitted gas over neighboring batteries, which causes the problem of consecutively deteriorating the batteries. In particular, in a battery module including a plurality of batteries, how expansion of the influence of a battery having a problem over neighboring batteries is controlled to a minimum is a problem to be solved.', 'Moreover, in the battery module described in Patent Document 3, the partitioning wall of the case has the openings facing the safety valves of the batteries so that the emitted gas does not fill the battery chamber, but is released to the outside. Patent Document 3 discloses a circuit board built in a resin, but fails to teach or suggest, for example, a method for connecting the circuit board to the batteries. Therefore, when a surface on a safety valve side of each battery is connected to a connector, it is not clear how air-tightness with respect to the partitioning wall is maintained. Further, it is difficult to position the safety valve of each battery to the opening portion of the partitioning wall, and thus positioning using recessed portions leaves space between the batteries, so that downsizing is not possible. Furthermore, the batteries and the circuit board are fixed and built in a resin, which poses a problem with downsizing the battery module.', 'In addition, when such a battery module including a large number of batteries is operated (charged/discharged) at a high electric power as a power supply, the amount of heat generated along with the charge/discharge is also large.

A layer having a higher etching rate than that of a layer that is to be left without etching removal is preferably formed as the area for etching removal.', 'In this manner, when the area for etching removal is provided in a porous layer side of the semiconductor film to be formed on the surface of the porous layer, the etching removal can be performed more rapidly and accurately.', 'Moreover, the thickness adjusting can be performed by forming an additional film on the surface of the reused semiconductor wafer after delaminating the semiconductor film having the device formed thereon.', 'In this case, the additional film can be formed on a surface on which the porous layer is to be formed of the reused semiconductor wafer. The additional film also can be formed on a surface opposite to a surface on which the porous layer is to be formed of the reused semiconductor wafer.', 'In this manner, the thickness of the semiconductor wafer having a multilayer film also can be adjusted by forming the additional film on the surface of the reused semiconductor wafer after delaminating the semiconductor film having the device formed thereon, and the semiconductor wafer having a multilayer film with the whole thickness satisfying the standard can be thereby provided. In addition, the additional film can be formed on either of a surface on which the porous layer is to be formed of the reused semiconductor wafer, and a surface opposite thereto.', 'Moreover, when the additional film is formed on the surface of the reused semiconductor wafer on an opposite side to the surface on a side of forming the porous layer, a polycrystalline film can be formed as the additional film.', 'In this manner, when the polycrystalline film is formed as the additional film on a back surface, it is low cost, and can serve as a gettering layer for contaminated materials such as metal impurities during heat treatment in a subsequent step of forming the device and the like.', 'Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for producing a semiconductor device, including the steps of: fabricating a device on the semiconductor film of the semiconductor wafer having a multilayer film produced by the method for producing a semiconductor wafer having a multilayer film according to any one of the above; and producing the semiconductor device by delaminating the semiconductor film along the porous layer, the semiconductor film having the device formed thereon.', 'In the above-described method for producing a semiconductor device, the semiconductor wafer having a multilayer film with the whole thickness satisfying the standard can be used, and the semiconductor device can be thereby produced without the limitation of the number of reuse.', 'Furthermore, the present invention provides a semiconductor wafer having a multilayer film for producing a semiconductor device, including a semiconductor wafer, a porous layer formed on a surface of the semiconductor wafer, and a semiconductor film formed on a surface of the porous layer, wherein the semiconductor film has an area for etching removal in a porous layer side.', 'The semiconductor wafer having a multilayer film in which the above-described area for etching removal is provided enables the semiconductor wafer having a multilayer film with the whole thickness satisfying the standard to be provided at low cost.', 'In this case, the wafer is highly useful for the case where a diameter of the semiconductor wafer is 450 mm or more.', 'In this manner, even when the semiconductor wafer has a large diameter of 450 mm or more, and the thickness of the wafer needs to be relatively thick because of a problem of wafer deflection due to an own weight, the semiconductor wafer for delamination can be repeatedly reused although the wafer is designed with a thickness that is thick enough to cope with the wafer deflection, and it can be low-cost.",0

"However, a PVDF layer has a property of being electrically charged easily, and thus easily charged with static electricity during a battery production process (for example, a separator conveying process at which friction is generated between a metal roll and the PVDF layer). Therefore, a separator having a PVDF layer is charged with static electricity and hardly slides, resulting the deterioration of the handling property. As a result, meandering occurs or wrinkles are generated during conveying the separator in the battery production process, which may cause a product defect of a battery. Even if a static electricity removing process to remove static electricity from a separator is provided, it is difficult to remove static electricity over the whole battery production process.', 'The invention was made in view of the above circumstances.', 'In view of the above circumstances, a separator for a non-aqueous secondary battery having good adhesiveness to an electrode and a good handling property is required.', 'Further, in view of the above circumstances, a non-aqueous secondary battery having good cycle characteristics and a high production yield is required.",2
"In a typical air-conditioning apparatus, the amount of refrigerant necessary during heating operation is smaller than the amount of refrigerant necessary during cooling operation. Particularly when the length of the extension pipe is large, the difference between the amount of refrigerant necessary during cooling operation and the amount of refrigerant necessary during heating operation is increased. As a refrigerant circuit configuration capable of absorbing this difference in necessary refrigerant amount, there is known a configuration in which, in addition to an expansion valve (indoor expansion valve) of the indoor unit, an expansion valve (main circuit expansion valve) is also arranged in the outdoor unit. Similarly to the internal heat exchanger of the air-conditioning apparatus disclosed in Patent Literatures 1 and 2, the main circuit expansion valve is arranged between the indoor expansion valve and the outdoor heat exchanger. During the heating operation, an opening degree of the main circuit expansion valve is appropriately reduced, to thereby accumulate the liquid-phase refrigerant in the extension pipe. With this, the difference in necessary refrigerant amount can be absorbed.', 'FIG. 9 is a Mollier chart illustrating an example of an operation state during the heating operation in the air-conditioning apparatus including the indoor expansion valve and the main circuit expansion valve. An opening degree of a main circuit expansion valve 103 is controlled so that a decompression amount (pressure difference “a”) at an indoor expansion valve 101 serving as an upstream-side expansion valve during the heating operation and a decompression amount (pressure difference “b”) at the main circuit expansion valve 103 serving as a downstream-side expansion valve are maintained to a predetermined ratio x:y. The ratio x:y can be arbitrarily set. Through setting of the pressure difference “a” small and the pressure difference “b” large as illustrated in FIG. 9, the refrigerant inside a liquid-side extension pipe 102 connecting the indoor unit and the outdoor unit to each other approaches a liquid phase, which makes it easier to absorb the difference between the amount of refrigerant necessary during cooling operation and the amount of refrigerant necessary during heating operation. For example, the opening degree of the main circuit expansion valve 103 is controlled based on a discharge pressure and a suction pressure of the compressor and a refrigerant circulating amount.', 'FIG. 10 is a Mollier chart illustrating an example of an operation state during the heating operation in the air-conditioning apparatus further including, in addition to the indoor expansion valve and the main circuit expansion valve, the injection circuit as disclosed in Patent Literature 1 or 2. In this case, an injection circuit expansion valve 104 in the injection circuit is controlled so that the discharge superheat of the compressor converges to a constant value.', 'When the injection circuit expansion valve 104 is in an open state, the downstream-side pressure difference “b” depends on not the opening degree of only the main circuit expansion valve 103 but the opening degrees of both of the main circuit expansion valve 103 and the injection circuit expansion valve 104. Therefore, unlike the case illustrated in FIG. 9, it becomes difficult to maintain the predetermined ratio x:y through the control of the opening degree of the main circuit expansion valve 103. Specifically, as illustrated in FIG. 10, the pressure difference “a” tends to increase, and the pressure difference “b” tends to decrease. In this case, the rate occupied by the two-phase refrigerant is increased in the liquid-side extension pipe 102, and hence the amount of refrigerant to be accumulated in the liquid-side extension pipe 102 during the heating operation is decreased. Therefore, there has been a problem in that it becomes difficult to absorb the difference between the amount of refrigerant necessary during cooling operation and the amount of refrigerant necessary during heating operation.', 'In the above-mentioned air-conditioning apparatus, in order to maintain the predetermined ratio x:y, it is conceivable to add an intermediate-pressure sensor for detecting the pressure (intermediate pressure) of the refrigerant that has passed through the indoor expansion valve 101. Specifically, it is conceivable to feedback control the opening degree of the main circuit expansion valve 103 based on the pressure difference “a” between the discharge pressure and the intermediate pressure and the pressure difference “b” between the intermediate pressure and the suction pressure so that the pressure difference “a” and the pressure difference “b” maintain the ratio x:y. However, in this case, it is necessary to add the intermediate-pressure sensor, and hence there has been a problem in that the manufacturing cost of the air-conditioning apparatus is increased.', 'The present invention has been made to solve at least one of the problems described above, and has an object to provide an air-conditioning apparatus capable of accumulating a larger amount of refrigerant in a refrigerant pipe during the heating operation while keeping the manufacturing cost low.",2

"Due to the above-described configuration of the first piezoelectric sensor, the piezoelectric sensor is provided with the exposed section formed without being covered by the ground electrodes and the signal electrode and with the both sides thereof being exposed to the ambient air even if water vapor, a solvent, a residual monomer, and the like are penetrated into the piezoelectric sheet which constitutes the piezoelectric sensor during the manufacturing of the piezoelectric sensor. Impurity compounds such as the water vapor, the solvent, and the residual monomer, penetrated into the piezoelectric sheet, can be smoothly released from the piezoelectric sheet through both the sides of the exposed section. Thus, the piezoelectric sensor of the present invention maintains an excellent piezoelectric property over a long period substantially without causing a deterioration in the piezoelectric property due to the penetration of a gas into the piezoelectric sheet thereof.', 'Due to the above-described configuration, the second piezoelectric sensor can be efficiently manufactured with the simple step of adhesively integrating the signal electrode sheet, and the first and second ground electrode sheets with the piezoelectric sheet.', 'Furthermore, in the second piezoelectric sensor, the fourth electrical insulation sheet is interposed between the signal electrode sheet and the second ground electrode sheet in the portion where the end face of the signal electrode sheet intersects with the end face of the second ground electrode sheet. Thus, a potential generated in the piezoelectric sheet can be stably taken out through the signal electrode without unexpectedly developing a short circuit between the signal electrode and the second ground electrode.', 'Due to the above-described configuration, the third piezoelectric sensor allows a conductive wire to be easily electrically connected to the piezoelectric sheet without damaging the piezoelectric sheet.', 'When a surface of the protruded connecting section in the signal electrode piercing terminal and the ground electrode piercing terminal (hereinafter, sometimes collectively referred to simply as a “piercing terminal”) closer to the piezoelectric sheet is used as a conductive wire connecting surface to be connected with the conductive wire in the above-described piezoelectric sheet, the use of solder on the conductive wire connecting surface in the protruded connecting section of the piercing terminal allows easy connection of the conductive wire to the electrode piercing terminal while reducing the thickness of the piezoelectric sensor as much as possible and thus achieves a size reduction in the piezoelectric sensor.', 'When gripping pieces for gripping the conductive wire connected to the conductive wire connecting surface are formed in the protruded connecting section in the signal electrode piercing terminal and the ground electrode piercing terminal in the above-described piezoelectric sensor, the conductive wire can be reliably fixed to the conductive wire connecting surface with the gripping pieces gripping the conductive wire, and a more reliable piezoelectric sensor can be therefore obtained.",1
"The matrix film deposition system according to the present invention aimed at solving the previously described problem is a system for depositing a film containing a matrix substance on a surface of a sample plate, the system including:', 'a) a first plate electrode having an attachment surface on which the sample plate is to be attached;', 'b) a second plate electrode arranged so as to face the attachment surface;', 'c) a nozzle for spraying a liquid containing a matrix substance into the space between the first plate electrode and the second plate electrode by an electrospray method, the nozzle arranged so that neither the first plate electrode nor the second plate electrode lies on the central axis of a spray flow of the liquid; and', 'd) an electric field creator for creating, between the first plate electrode and the second plate electrode, an electric field for forcing electrically charged droplets of the liquid containing the matrix substance contained in the spray flow to move toward the attachment surface.', 'As just described, in the matrix film deposition system according to the present invention, the nozzle and the two (first and second) plate electrodes are arranged so that, when the liquid containing the matrix substance (matrix liquid) is sprayed from the nozzle by an electrospray method, the central axis of the spray flow passes through the space between the two plate electrodes and does not intersect with any of these plate electrodes. The electric field created by the electric field creator has the effect of forcing the electrically charged droplets of the matrix liquid passing through the space between the two plate electrodes to move in the direction from the second electrode to the first plate electrode and be eventually deposited on the sample plate attached to the first plate electrode. In this process, only the electrically charged droplets of the matrix liquid are attracted toward the first electrode; neutral particles without any electric charges will not be attracted toward the first plate electrode but directly pass through the space between the two plate electrodes. Thus, the deposition of the neutral particles contained in the spray flow is prevented and a matrix film containing a low amount of impurities is obtained.', 'In the present invention, the requirement that the second plate electrode be “arranged so as to face” the attachment surface does not always literally mean that these two elements should directly face each other. For example, the second plate electrode may be inclined from the attachment surface. In this case, the angle made by the attachment surface with the second plate electrode should preferably be 30 degrees or less, and more preferably, 10 degrees or less.', 'Furthermore, the second plate electrode does not need to have its central point located on the normal to the attachment surface at the central point of this surface.', 'That is to say, the minimal requirement is that the first and second plate electrodes be arranged so that, when DC voltage is applied between them, an electric field which forces the electrically charged droplets in the spray flow to move in a direction intersecting the central axis of the spray flow is created in the space between the attachment surface of the first plate electrode and the surface of the second plate electrode facing the spray flow.', 'In one mode of the matrix film deposition system according to the present invention, the nozzle includes:', 'e) a capillary having a tubular shape for allowing the liquid containing the matrix substance to flow from the proximal end to a droplet-spraying hole formed at the distal end; and', 'f) a nebulizer gas ejection passage extending in parallel with the capillary, for ejecting a nebulizer gas into a region near the droplet-spraying hole, and the system further includes:', 'g) a voltage supplier for applying DC voltage to the capillary.', 'According to this configuration, the matrix liquid inside the capillary is electrically charged due to the effect of the electric field created at the tip of the capillary by the voltage applied from the voltage supplier. This electrically charged matrix liquid is sheared by the nebulizer gas and sprayed from the droplet-spraying hole.', 'A possible example of the matrix film deposition system having such a configuration is a system in which the nozzle is constructed as a double-tube structure including the capillary as the inner tube and the nebulizer gas tube as the outer tube. In this case, the space between the outer circumferential surface of the capillary and the inner circumferential surface of the nebulizer gas tube functions as the nebulizer gas ejection passage.', 'In another mode of the matrix film deposition system according to the present invention, the nozzle includes:', 'h) a capillary having a tubular shape for allowing the liquid containing the matrix substance to flow from the proximal end to a droplet-spraying hole formed at the distal end, and the system further includes:', 'i) a facing electrode located at a position facing the tip of the nozzle; and', 'j) a voltage supplier for applying DC voltage between the capillary and the facing electrode.', 'The matrix film deposition system according to this mode of the present invention is configured to spray electrically charged droplets by the so-called “nano-electrospray” process. According to this configuration, a strong electric field is created in a region near the droplet-spraying hole by producing a considerable potential difference between the capillary and the facing electrode by the voltage supplier. Due to this electric field, the liquid containing the matrix substance is electrically charged and separated into positive and negative ions. Then, ions having a polarity to be attracted toward the facing electrode (i.e. the ions derived from the matrix substance), in the form of solute ions contained in the liquid, are extracted from the nozzle and sprayed.",0

"As disclosed in Patent Literature 1, it is effective to improve the magnetic characteristics by controlling a composition of main crystal grains that constitute the sintered Sr ferrite magnet. However, it is difficult to greatly improve the magnetic characteristics of the sintered Sr ferrite magnet in the related art by controlling only the composition of crystal grains. As another means for improving the magnetic characteristics of the sintered Sr ferrite magnet, a configuration in which a structure is made fine is considered. As means for making the structure fine, a configuration in which Sr ferrite particles used as a raw material of the sintered Sr ferrite magnet are made fine is considered. As a method of making the Sr ferrite particles fine, a method of finely pulverizing the Sr ferrite particles in a mechanical manner, or a method of lengthening a pulverizing time is exemplified. However, when the Sr ferrite particles are finely pulverized in the mechanical manner as described above, there is a concern such as broadening of a particle size distribution, an increase in production cost due to an increase in power consumption, abrasion of a facility, and the like, and a decrease in a yield ratio.', 'As the sintered Sr ferrite magnet, currently, an anisotropic sintered Sr ferrite magnet, which is subjected to crystal orientation in a c-axis direction, is mainly used. In a case of producing the anisotropic sintered Sr ferrite magnet, it is necessary for a ferrite forming reaction to sufficiently progress in a calcining step so as to increase an orientation due to a magnetic field of ferrite particles at a step of manufacturing a molded body. Therefore, in the related art, calcination is performed at a high temperature of 1250° C. or higher. As a result, the energy cost in the calcining step increases, and the ferrite particles are subjected to grain growth to several μm to several tens of μm. It is difficult to uniformly make the ferrite particles fine, which are subjected to the grain growth as described above, to 1 μm or less so as to improve the magnetic characteristics of the sintered Sr ferrite magnet. In addition, there is a concern that the cost for pulverization of the Sr ferrite particles also increases.', 'Examples of a method of obtaining a fine Sr ferrite particle include a co-precipitation method, a flux method in which a flux is added, and the like. However, in a case of producing the Sr ferrite powders by the above-described method, troublesome operations such as a flux washing step and preparation of a solution are necessary. Accordingly, a process becomes complicated, and the production cost increases. In consideration of these situations, it is demanded to establish a production method capable of producing the sintered Sr ferrite magnet having high magnetic characteristics by a simple step and with a low production cost. In addition, it is demanded to establish a production method capable of producing Sr ferrite particles suitable for producing of the sintered Sr ferrite magnet having high magnetic characteristics by a simple process and with a low production cost.', 'However, the sintered Sr ferrite magnet is frequently used in motors and generators. Accordingly, the sintered Sr ferrite magnet is demanded to be excellent in reliability to avoid a situation in which the sintered Sr ferrite magnet is broken or peeled off and falls down during use of the motors or the generators, thereby breaking the motors or the generators.', 'The invention has been made in consideration of the above-described circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a method for producing a sintered Sr ferrite magnet which is capable of producing the sintered Sr ferrite magnet having excellent magnetic characteristics and high reliability with a simple process. In addition, another object of the invention is to provide a method for producing Sr ferrite particles suitable for producing of the sintered Sr ferrite magnet, and a method for using the Sr ferrite particles.

"In this regard, in this internal combustion engine, when the first NOx removal method is being used, as explained above, the NOx contained in the exhaust gas is reduced by the reducing intermediate which is held on the basic layer, and the amount of hydrocarbons which is required for generating this reducing intermediate is fed from the hydrocarbon feed valve. On the other hand, when the second NOx removal method is being used, the stored NOx is released from the exhaust purification catalyst and reduced by making the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing into the exhaust purification catalyst rich. In this regard, to make the NOx which was once stored in the exhaust purification catalyst be released from the exhaust purification catalyst and be reduced in this way, a large amount of reducing agent becomes necessary. Therefore, the amount of reducing agent which is required for releasing the stored NOx from the exhaust purification catalyst and reduce it in the second NOx removal method, that is, the amount of fuel which is required for making the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas rich, is larger compared with the amount of hydrocarbons, that is, the amount of reducing agent, which is required for generating the reducing intermediate in the first NOx removal method. That is, the amount of reducing agent which is required for removing the NOx is greater in the case of using the second NOx removal method compared with the case of using the first NOx removal method. Therefore, it is preferable to use the first NOx removal method as much as possible.', 'In this regard, the first NOx removal method gives a high purification efficiency at the higher side of temperature of the exhaust purification catalyst compared with the second NOx removal method. Therefore, if the temperature of the exhaust purification catalyst rises, an NOx removal method is switched from the second NOx removal method to the first NOx removal method. In this case, as explained above, it is preferable to use the first NOx removal method as much as possible, so the temperature of the exhaust purification catalyst when an NOx removal method is switched from the second NOx removal method to the first NOx removal method is preferably as low as possible. However, it was learned that the allowable lower limit temperature of the exhaust purification catalyst which gives a good NOx removal rate using the first NOx removal method is affected by the amount of NOx which is contained in the exhaust gas and that this allowable lower limit temperature becomes lower the more the amount of NOx which is contained in the exhaust gas increases. The reason will be explained in detail later.', 'Note that, in the above-mentioned known internal combustion engine, an NOx removal method is switched from the second NOx removal method to the first NOx removal method by using a different judgment criteria from the present invention.",2

"In a case where a high-output light emitting apparatus is prepared, it is necessary to improve efficiency of radiating heat which occurs from a light emitting element and the like. In this regard, a ceramic substrate which has been conventionally used is insufficient in heat conducting property, and it is therefore necessary to use a metal substrate having a higher heat conducting property. Further, it is necessary to provide an insulating layer on the metal substrate for forming a wiring pattern on the metal substrate. Furthermore, for improving light utilization efficiency of the light emitting apparatus, the insulating layer needs to have a high heat conducting property and a high light reflecting property.', 'However, an organic resist, which has conventionally been used as an insulating layer on a substrate of the light emitting apparatus, has a problem that a heat conducting property, a heat resistance, and a light resistance cannot be sufficiently obtained.

"Specifically, an exhaust gas measuring information processing apparatus according to the present invention includes a reception circuit that receives a flow rate measurement signal indicating a flow rate measurement value of exhaust gas flowing through an exhaust gas tube of an internal combustion engine and an operational state signal indicating an operational state of the internal combustion engine, and a processing executing circuit that executes predetermined processing relevant to maintenance and check of a flow sensor that outputs the flow rate measurement signal when a predetermined correlation is not satisfied between an index value for the operational state indicated by the operational state signal and the flow rate measurement value indicated by the flow rate measurement signal.', 'Further, an exhaust gas measuring system according to the present invention includes the exhaust gas measuring information processing apparatus, the flow sensor that measures a flow rate of the exhaust gas flowing through the exhaust gas tube of the internal combustion engine and outputs the flow rate measurement signal indicating the flow rate measurement value, and an operational state detecting sensor that detects the operational state of the internal combustion engine and outputs the operational state signal indicating the detected operational state.', 'Further, a program according to the present invention causes the exhaust gas measuring information processing apparatus to function as the reception circuit that receives the flow rate measurement signal indicating the flow rate measurement value of the exhaust gas flowing through the exhaust gas tube of the internal combustion engine and the operational state signal indicating the operational state of the internal combustion engine, and the processing executing circuit that executes the predetermined processing relevant to the maintenance and check of the flow sensor that outputs the flow rate measurement signal when the predetermined correlation is not satisfied between the index value for the operational state indicated by the operational state signal and the flow rate measurement value indicated by the flow rate measurement signal.', 'According to the above-described exhaust gas measuring information processing apparatus, exhaust gas measuring system and exhaust gas measuring program, when the predetermined correlation is not satisfied between the index value for the operational state indicated by the operational state signal at the time in which the internal combustion engine is under operation, namely, at the time in which the exhaust gas should flow, and the flow rate measurement value indicated by the flow rate measurement signal during the measurement of the exhaust gas flow rate of the internal combustion engine, it is possible to determine that the predetermined correlation is not satisfied due to troubles with the flow sensor. The predetermined correlation indicates that when the internal combustion engine is under operation, the flow rate measurement value increases above the predetermined value or decreases below the predetermined value in accordance with a change in the increase or decrease of the index value.', 'When the flow rate measurement value measured by the flow sensor does not satisfy the predetermined value, for example, if the flow rate measurement value is zero, troubles occur in the flow sensor, and as a result, the predetermined processing relevant to the maintenance and check of the flow sensor is performed. Therefore, the predetermined processing is performed at appropriate timing such as at the time at which the troubles occur, and further, the predetermined processing is not forcibly performed, but rather unnecessary processing is avoided.', 'One specific example where it is recognized that the predetermined correlation is not satisfied, is the case in which it is determined that the internal combustion engine is under operation, on the basis of the index value for the operational state which is indicated by the operational state signal, and the flow rate measurement value indicated by the flow rate measurement signal is less than the predetermined value.', 'The predetermined processing relevant to the maintenance and check of the flow sensor includes processing steps such as alerting an operator to perform maintenance and check, in addition to the ordering by the processing executing circuit to other devices to perform maintenance and check operation.', 'For example, as a specific aspect of the predetermined processing, an abnormality in the flow sensor is reported to the operator via a screen or by sound.', 'In particular, when the flow sensor includes a sensor main body and a conversion circuit that converts an output signal from the sensor main body into the flow rate measurement signal, and the sensor main body includes an exhaust gas introduction tube which is attached to the exhaust gas tube and into which the exhaust gas is introduced, the abnormality is caused in many cases due to clogging of the exhaust gas introduction tube. Therefore, it is preferable that a message “purge is necessary” be displayed as an abnormality report.', 'Preferably, in the processing executing circuit, it is sufficient to just start the purge operation for the exhaust gas introduction tube as the predetermined processing at timing when the predetermined correlation is not satisfied. According to this arrangement, it is possible to purge the exhaust gas introduction tube automatically, thereby enabling to save power.', 'As a specific aspect in which existing devices are used as far as possible to realize a simplified configuration without providing a dedicated sensor, there is a case in which the operational state detecting sensor that outputs the operational state signal, detects as the index value, a rotation speed of the internal combustion engine, or an intake air flow rate of the internal combustion engine, or a fuel consumption of the internal combustion engine, or a concentration of a predetermined component contained in the exhaust gas, and the processing executing circuit determines that the internal combustion engine is in an operational state when the index value is more than the predetermined value.', 'As the operational state detecting sensor, an engine rotational speed sensor previously mounted on a vehicle, a CO2 concentration meter mounted on the exhaust gas measuring system, or the like can be used. Therefore, the quantity of dedicated devices or dedicated processes for a diagnosis of the flow sensor can be reduced. For example, the process flowing a standard gas whose flow rate changes in a predetermined pattern in order to check an output of the flow sensor, can be reduced. Or, alternatively, the dedicated devices required for processing a flowing a standard gas whose flow rate changes in a predetermined pattern in order to check an output of the flow sensor, can be reduced. This makes it possible to shorten the time it takes to conduct the whole exhaust gas measurement process including preparatory work, and work conducted between, and after measurement. Furthermore, it is possible to simplify the configuration of the exhaust gas measuring system.', 'When the exhaust gas measuring system is a vehicle-mounted type exhaust gas measuring system further including a concentration measuring sensor that measures the predetermined component concentration in the exhaust gas and a component exhaust amount calculation circuit that calculates an exhaust amount of the predetermined component on the basis of a product of measurement concentration of the predetermined component measured by the concentration measuring sensor and the flow rate measurement value measured by the flow sensor, effects of the present invention are exerted more significantly.', 'Specifically, the vehicle-mounted type exhaust gas measuring system is used for a vehicle that travels on a road rather than on a test bench such as a chassis dynamometer. Such a road traveling test may be performed for several hours. Further, since the road traveling test may be performed only by a vehicle driver, it is difficult to always monitor all measurement data compared with a test on the test bench. In the case when clogging, or other complication, occurs in the flow sensor during the above road traveling test, but the road traveling test is continued without being aware of the clogging, or other complication, data recorded after trouble has occurred in the flow sensor becomes wasted, and the time spent on the travel is wasted as well.', 'In contrast to the above, according to the present exhaust gas measuring system, it is possible to find out the abnormality of the flow sensor in real time while the vehicle is traveling, as described above, and to take action to normalize the situation. As a result, it is possible to eliminate the wasted test data and travel time by interrupting the road traveling test on the spot and removing as much as possible of the invalid data from the time that the vehicle was traveled with the clogging, or other complication, and then normalizing the situation with appropriate actions.', 'As one specific aspect of the exhaust gas measuring system, the operational state detecting sensor is a CO2 sensor that measures concentration of CO2 in the exhaust gas, and the processing executing circuit recognizes the measurement concentration of the CO2 as the index value for the operational state, and determines that the internal combustion engine is under operation in the case when the index value is more than the predetermined value.', 'In particular, when determining the operational state based on a component of the exhaust gas, it is preferable to use CO2 concentration. CO2 is surely contained in the exhaust gas, and CO2 is hardly influenced by catalysts and other potential interferences that may be present along the path of the exhaust gas tube. Therefore, when CO2 is detected, it can be reliably determined that the exhaust gas is flowing and the internal combustion engine is under operation.",0

"When a conventional liquid or film adhesive is used for the material for connecting the semiconductor chips or connecting the semiconductor chip and the supporting member for mounting a semiconductor chip, the following problem occurs. For example, in a case of the liquid adhesive, if the amount thereof applied is excessively high, the resin may run off from a chip in a bonding process, move up along the side surface of the chip and contaminate a bonding tool when a recent thin-film chip is mounted.', 'In contrast, in the case of the film adhesive, it is easy to apply an optimum amount of resin by adjusting the thickness of the film; however, a step of bonding the film adhesive to a base called a provisional compression-bonding step is required. Generally, in the provisional compression-bonding step, a film adhesive having slits at the intervals larger than the width of a target chip to be bonded, and wound around a reel is prepared, and the film adhesive on the base is cut depending upon the size of the chip and bonded to the base by thermocompression bonding at a temperature such that the resin does not react. However, it is difficult to supply the film with high dimensional accuracy to a chip mounting position, and to perform thin-width reel processing dealing with microchips or the like. From these, a film adhesive bonded in the provisional compression-bonding is generally made larger than a chip size in order to ensure yield. Therefore, there has been the following problem; the margin needs to be provided in a distance to an adjacent portion, which makes it difficult to deal with high-density mounting.', 'A method for forming an adhesive layer in a wafer process has attracted attention as the measure for solving the above problem. In order to form the adhesive layer in the wafer process, it is necessary to have for example flat film formability without depending on a level difference derived from a circuit, uniform highly precise pattern processability, and adaptability to a rewiring process, a connecting terminal forming process, and a dicing process or the like in addition to the conventional photosensitivity and adhesion.', 'The present invention has been made in consideration of these circumstances, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a photosensitive resin composition providing excellent pattern formability, film stability, and embedding property when the photosensitive resin composition is formed into a film shape and used, and sufficiently suppressing voids at the time of bonding at high temperature, a film adhesive, an adhesive sheet, an adhesive pattern, a semiconductor wafer with an adhesive layer, and a semiconductor device using the same.",2

"The motivation of using time warping is to obtain consistent pitch within one frame and improve coding efficiency. Time warping relies on accuracy in pitch tracking to a certain extent.', 'However, there is a problem that the pitch contour detection may be difficult because of change in the amplitude and cycle of a signal. Although some post processing schemes, such as smoothing, fine tuning of threshold parameters, have been used in order to improve the pitch detection accuracy, these schemes are based on particular databases.', 'When time warping is applied based on an inaccurate pitch contour, the sound quality deteriorates and the bits used for sending the time-warping information are wasted. It is therefore necessary to design time warping which is not blindly based on a detected pitch contour.', 'Currently, there is no method of coding pitch contour information which can work efficiently in the time warping in the conventional techniques.', 'In the conventional techniques, a fixed table is used for representing a pitch contour.', 'A smaller table is not sufficient for the situation in which the pitch changes dramatically, while a larger table occupies more bits.', 'It is likely to be costly especially in low bitrate coding. It is a trade-off for improvement in the coding efficiency by using bits for sending time-warping parameters.', 'Therefore, with a more efficient method of coding time-warping parameters, saved bits can be used for transform coding and a signal with larger pitch changes can be supported, so that sound quality is improved.', 'A simple way to implement a time-warping scheme into a transform coding system is to concatenate the time-warping scheme directly with transform coding. In the conventional techniques, time-warping schemes are independent of transform coding. Since a target of the time warping is to improve transform coding efficiency, the time warping can benefit from using some coding information from a transform coding system. In view of this, the present invention has an object of improving current transform coding structures with a time-warping scheme.', 'The present invention has another object of providing an encoding device and a decoding device which use pitch change ratios (see a ratio 88 in FIG. 18) across an appropriate range (see a range 86). The present invention has another object of providing an encoding device which performs an appropriate process for pitch change ratios (see a ratio 88 in FIG. 18) across a wider range such that sound quality is improved.

"The use of an anisotropic conductive film containing the adhesive agent for electrode connection described in Patent Literature 1 makes it possible to assuredly connect electrodes arranged at a fine pitch (electrodes with a minimum pitch of 200 μm or less) on a flexible printed wiring board or a rigid board and maintain insulation resistance between adjacent electrodes. However, in recent years, trends toward a finer pitch have required a flexible printed wiring board or a rigid board having electrodes with a minimum pitch of 150 μm or less. For electrodes having a minimum pitch of 150 μm or less, the distance between adjacent electrodes in the planar direction is reduced compared with the case of a minimum pitch of 200 μm or less, so that high insulation performance is required. Thus, even in the case of the anisotropic conductive film containing the adhesive agent for electrode connection described in Patent Literature 1, the cured material composed of the thermosetting resin having a glass-transition temperature of 90° C. or higher, it is difficult to maintain insulation reliability between adjacent electrodes in the planar direction.', 'Meanwhile, in an anisotropic conductive film using an adhesive agent, containing a thermosetting resin having a simply increased glass-transition temperature, for electrode connection, the ease of repair described above (hereinafter, referred to as “repairability”) is disadvantageously reduced.', 'The present invention has been made in light of the foregoing problems.

In the dome section reinforcing layers, FRP are wound in such a manner that the orientation angle in the cylindrical section is continuously changed, and as a result, the weight of the FRP that are wound around the portion in the vicinity of the center of the cylindrical section is reduced.', 'Concretely, FRP are continuously wound around the entirety of the cylindrical portion starting from the left and right dome sections, and at the same time, the orientation angle of FRP over the cylindrical section relative to the direction of the axis of the liner continuously becomes smaller towards the center of the cylindrical section so that the orientation angle becomes the smallest at the center of the cylindrical section (claim 2).', 'Alternatively, FRP are wound around the left and right portions of the cylindrical section that are separate with the center portion where FRP are not wound in between, and the orientation angle of FRP relative to the direction of the axis of the liner in a region over the cylindrical section around which FRP are wound continuously becomes greater towards the center of the cylindrical section so that the orientation angle becomes maximum at the point closest to the center, and the direction of the winding is reversed at this point (claim 3).",0

"As a result of an intensive study, the inventors of the present invention have found that: in a case where an all-solid-state battery is charged to a predetermined SOC without having Li precipitation, the battery can be charged to an intended SOC without having Li precipitation if the degree of degradation of the all-solid-state battery is low, even if the charging current value is relatively increased. The inventors also have found that: in order to charge a degraded all-solid-state battery to a high SOC with the charging current value increased and without causing Li precipitation, it is effective to charge the battery with the temperature of the battery increased. Further, the inventors have found that: regarding an all-solid-state battery in which degradation has proceeded to a degree that Li precipitation occurs before an intended SOC is obtained when the battery is charged with the charging current value increased and with the temperature increased, it is possible to charge the battery to the intended SOC while inhibiting Li precipitation, by charging the battery in a state in which the charging current value is decreased or in a state in which both the charging current value and the temperature of the all-solid-state battery are decreased. The present invention has been made based on the above findings.', 'In order to solve the above problems, the present invention takes the following means. Namely, a first aspect of the present invention is a control device of battery charging including: a first output unit outputting a heating signal to heat a battery; a second output unit outputting a charging signal to charge the battery heated according to the heating signal; and a controller judging whether or not a degree of degradation of the battery is a first value or more, wherein where the controller judges the degree of degradation to be the first value or more, the controller controls the heating signal so as to make the charging rate of the battery whose degree of degradation is the first value or more equal to or closer to a charging rate of the battery when the degree of degradation is less than the first value.', 'In the first aspect of the present invention, the configuration of the “battery” is not particularly limited, and for example an all-solid-state battery can be preferably used. Also, in the first aspect of the present invention, machinery with which the “battery” is equipped can have one or more selected from the group consisting of the first output unit, the second output unit, and the controller, or can have none of them. In a case where the machinery with which the battery is equipped does not have the first output unit, the second output unit, or the controller, for example the first output unit can be provided to a heating device which heats the battery, and provided outside the machinery with which the battery is equipped. The second output unit and the controller can be provided to a feeding device or the like which feeds electricity into the battery, such as a charger. Also, in the first aspect of the present invention and other aspects of the present invention shown below (hereinafter, these aspects may be collectively referred to as “the present invention”), the term “degree of degradation” can be obtained by a charging curve (a curve which shows a relationship between voltage and battery capacity, wherein the voltage is taken along the vertical axis and the battery capacity is taken long the horizontal axis), a battery resistance obtainable from a response of pulse current, and the like. Also, in the present invention, the “first value” is not particularly limited, and arbitrarily determined by a manufacturer of the battery, manufacturer of the charger, manufacturer of battery-equipped machinery and the like. The specific value of the first value differs depending on the structure and a use mode of the battery, the thinking way regarding the allowable degree of degradation, and the like. For example, the first value can be a value obtained when the performance is degraded by at least 0.01% and around 5% from the initial performance. According to the first aspect of the present invention, by controlling the temperature of the battery whose degree of degradation is the first value or more according to the heating signal, it is possible to inhibit occurrence of defects in the battery, even if the battery is charged at the same rate as the charging rate when a battery which can exert its initial performance is quickly charged. Therefore, such a configuration makes it possible to provide a control device of battery charging capable of quickly charging a battery to an intended capacity while inhibiting occurrence of defects in the battery.', 'A second aspect of the present invention is a control device of battery charging including: a first output unit outputting a heating signal to heat a battery equipped on a vehicle; a second output unit outputting a charging signal to charge the battery heated according to the heating signal; and a controller judging whether or not a degree of degradation of the battery is a first value or more and being equipped on the vehicle, wherein where the controller judges the degree of degradation to be the first value or more, the controller controls the heating signal so as to make the charging rate of the battery whose degree of degradation is the first value or more equal to or closer to a charging rate of the battery when the degree of degradation is less than the first value. Even with a configuration in which the controller equipped with the vehicle with which the battery is equipped controls the temperature of the battery to be charged, it is possible to exert the same effect as that of the first aspect of the present invention. Therefore, such a configuration also makes it possible to provide a control device of battery charging capable of quickly charging a battery to an intended capacity while inhibiting occurrence of defects in the battery.', 'A third aspect of the present invention is a control device of battery charging including: a first output unit outputting a heating signal to heat a battery equipped on a vehicle; a second output unit outputting a charging signal to charge the battery heated according to the heating signal; and a controller judging whether or not a degree of degradation of the battery is a first value or more and being equipped with a feeding device feeding electricity into the battery, the feeding device being arranged outside the vehicle, wherein where the controller judges the degree of degradation to be the first value or more, the controller controls the heating signal so as to make the charging rate of the battery whose degree of degradation is the first value or more equal to or closer to a charging rate of the battery when the degree of degradation is less than the first value. Even with the configuration in which the temperature of the battery to be charged is controlled by the controller equipped with the feeding device, it is possible to exert the same effect as that of the first aspect of the present invention. Therefore, such a configuration also makes it possible to provide a control device of battery charging capable of quickly charging a battery to an intended capacity, while inhibiting occurrence of defects in the battery.', 'Also, in the first aspect to the third aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the controller controls the heating signal so as to raise temperature of the battery. Such a configuration makes it easy to maintain the charging rate of the battery, whereby it becomes easy to quickly charge the battery to an intended capacity, while inhibiting occurrence of defects in the battery.', 'Also, in the first aspect to the third aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that where the controller judges the degree of degradation to be equal to or greater than a second value which is greater than the first value, the controller controls the heating signal and/or the charging signal, so as to make the charging rate of the battery slower than a charging rate of the battery when the degree of degradation is no less than the first value and less than the second value. If the battery whose degradation has proceeded to the second value or more is heated and subjected to a continuous quick charge, defects can occur to the battery before the intended SOC is obtained. According to the present invention in which the degree of degradation is made to be slower than the charging rate of the battery when the degree of degradation is no less than the first value and less than the second value, where the degree of degradation of the battery is equal to or greater than the second value, it is easy to prevent a situation in which defects occur in the battery.",0

"A control system for a nuclear power facility according to the present invention includes: a safety main control device that outputs a first safety mode operating signal which operates an apparatus provided in the nuclear power facility to a safety mode when an abnormality occurs in the nuclear power facility, and outputs a first unsafety mode operating signal which operates the apparatus to an unsafety mode when the nuclear power facility normally operates; a normal auxiliary control device that outputs a second safety mode operating signal which operates the apparatus to a safety mode when an abnormality occurs in the nuclear power facility, and assists the main control device; and an operating signal input/output unit to which various operating signals output from the main control device and the auxiliary control device are input, and which outputs a third safety mode operating signal that operates the apparatus to a safety mode or a second unsafety mode operating signal that operates the apparatus to an unsafety mode based on the input various operating signals, wherein the operating signal input/output unit includes an OR circuit capable of outputting the third safety mode operating signal based on the presence or absence of an input of the first safety mode operating signal, and the presence or absence of an input of the second safety mode operating signal, a NOT circuit connected to an output side of the OR circuit, and is capable of negating and outputting the presence or absence of an input of the third safety mode operating signal, and an AND circuit capable of outputting the second unsafety mode operating signal based on the presence or absence of an input of a signal output from the NOT circuit, and the presence or absence of an input of the first unsafety mode operating signal.', 'According to this configuration, when the normal auxiliary control device outputs the second safety mode operating signal to the OR circuit without the safety main control device outputting the first safety mode operating signal to the OR circuit due to a malfunction during an occurrence of abnormality of the nuclear power facility, the first safety mode operating signal is not input to the OR circuit, and the second safety mode operating signal is input to the OR circuit. In this case, the OR circuit may output the third safety mode operating signal. In this way, the operating signal input/output unit may cause the second safety mode operating signal from the normal auxiliary control device to be prioritized without inhibiting the first safety mode operating signal from the safety main control device. On the other hand, when the safety main control device normally operates and outputs the first safety mode operating signal to the OR circuit, and the normal auxiliary control device outputs the second safety mode operating signal to the OR circuit, the first safety mode operating signal is input to the OR circuit, and the second safety mode operating signal is input to the OR circuit. In this case, the OR circuit may output the third safety mode operating signal. In this way, the operating signal input/output unit may output the first safety mode operating signal from the safety main control device without being inhibited by the second safety mode operating signal from the normal auxiliary control device. In addition, even when the main control device outputs the first unsafety mode operating signal to the AND circuit due to a malfunction during an occurrence of abnormality of the nuclear power facility, the third safety mode operating signal output from the OR circuit is input to the AND circuit as no input by passing through the NOT circuit. For this reason, the AND circuit may block the first unsafety mode operating signal by the signal corresponding to the absence of an input from the NOT circuit. Thus, the operating signal input/output unit may output the second unsafety mode operating signal based on the presence or absence of an output of the third safety mode operating signal.', 'In this case, it is preferable that the auxiliary control device includes an automatic auxiliary control unit capable of automatically outputting the second safety mode operating signal when an abnormality occurs in the nuclear power facility, a manual auxiliary control unit capable of manually outputting the second safety mode operating signal, and an auxiliary side OR circuit capable of outputting the second safety mode operating signal based on the presence or absence of an input of the second safety mode operating signal output from the automatic auxiliary control unit, and the presence or absence of an input of the second safety mode operating signal output from the manual auxiliary control unit.', 'According to this configuration, it is possible to automatically or manually output the second safety mode operating signal output from the auxiliary control device. Thus, the auxiliary control device may be appropriately classified into a case of automatically outputting the second safety mode operating signal and a case of manually outputting the second safety mode operating signal depending on the intended use.', 'In this case, it is preferable that the manual auxiliary control unit includes an operation unit capable of manually outputting the second safety mode operating signal, signal output permission unit capable of outputting an enabling signal that permits an output of the second safety mode operating signal by the operation unit, and an auxiliary side AND circuit capable of outputting the second safety mode operating signal based on the presence or absence of an input of the second safety mode operating signal output from the operation unit, and the presence or absence of an input of the enabling signal.', 'According to this configuration, when the enabling signal is input, and the second safety mode operating signal is input, the manual auxiliary control unit may output the second safety mode operating signal. That is, when the enabling signal is not input, the manual auxiliary control unit may not output the second safety mode operating signal even when an operator erroneously operates an operating unit. Thus, the manual auxiliary control unit may reduce an erroneous operation of an operator by providing a signal output permission unit.', 'In this case, it is preferable that the signal output permission unit is a circuit breaker that supplies power to the manual auxiliary control unit, and the enabling signal is input to the auxiliary side AND circuit when power is supplied to the manual auxiliary control unit by the circuit breaker.', 'According to this configuration, the manual auxiliary control unit may cause the enabling signal to be input to the auxiliary side AND circuit when the circuit breaker supplies power to the manual auxiliary control unit, and may cause the enabling signal not to be input to the auxiliary side AND circuit when the circuit breaker blocks a power supply to the manual auxiliary control unit. Thus, an operator may simply input the enabling signal by operating the circuit breaker. In addition, a dedicated apparatus for inputting the enabling signal is not newly needed.",0

With the technique described in PTL 4, however, the adhesion property is not always sufficient, for example, in the process of forming the separator into a desired shape, in the process of assembling the fuel cell, or when the fuel cell vibrates violently during use, and there is a possibility that the layer peels.', 'It could therefore be helpful to provide a stainless-steel foil for a separator of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell not only having excellent electric conductivity but also having both excellent corrosion resistance in the use environment of separators of polymer electrolyte fuel cells and excellent adhesion property between the substrate and the Sn alloy layer even in the case where the Sn alloy layer is made thinner.",2

"In this situation, when using this X-ray detector, it is necessary to convert detected data, that is, frame data, to frame data according to the initial (i.e., before being obliquely set) Cartesian coordinate system whose one axis is along the scan direction. Hence, in the system adopting the foregoing oblique-arrangement X-ray detector, a sub-pixel technique is, by way of example, used to convert the detected frame data to frame data in the initial Cartesian coordinate system.', 'On one hand, there has been a strong demand for improving accuracy in inspecting foreign matter which may be contained in food or other objects. As one type of this foreign matter inspection apparatus, there is known an in-line X-ray inspection apparatus. This apparatus can be used preferably in inspecting many kinds of food in the line production. One typical example of this apparatus is that the apparatus is provided with a conveyor belt running at a speed, for example, of 60 m/min. and food to be inspected (e.g., vegetables such as green peppers, food such as baked bread, or meat blocks) is placed on the conveyor belt. Above the conveyor belt, an X-ray generator is installed and, under the belt on which the food is placed, i.e., in a space enclosed by the circulated belt, a strip-shaped X-ray detector is installed which has a detection window covering the width of the belt. Frame data outputted at a constant rate from the detector are subjected, for example, to mutual addition in synchronization with a running speed of the conveyor belt, which is able to generate X-ray tomographic images of an object for the inspection.', 'In this way, in this apparatus, it is required to process the outputted frame data at a higher processing speed. By necessity, the higher-speed processing will raise amounts of calculation (i.e., calculation load) carried out in a processing apparatus (including a CPU) which generates images. One solution to meet such larger amounts of calculation is parallel use of a plurality of calculators or installment of a calculator with a higher-speed calculation function. However, such a solution results in an increase in parts cost and/or growth in the apparatus size.",2
"In the case of composing a fuel cell stack by such fuel cells described above, the fuel cell stack is pressurized in a stacking direction in order to maintain assembling accuracy, a gas sealing property, and electrical conductivity in good condition. In conventional fuel cells, separators are in contact with both a membrane electrode assembly and a resin frame. Therefore, at the time of pressurization of a fuel cell stack, the contact portions between the resin frame and the separators are also pressurized. As a result, an interface pressure between the membrane electrode assembly and the respective separators is decreased (namely, a so-called pressure relief is caused). In particular, the problem of a pressure relief becomes prominent with decrease in thickness of the respective membrane electrode assembly and separators to downsize the fuel cell stack. Accordingly, in such conventional fuel cells, a problem of an increase in contact resistance between a membrane electrode assembly and each separator is caused.

"In the simulator disclosed in PTL 1, in order to analyze the energy balance of the entire product, as the basic state quantity representing the state of a system, a distribution amount such as current and force and a difference amount such as voltage and speed are adopted. Then, by analyzing the exchange of the two basic state quantities among the component parts of the product, the energy balance of the whole product is analyzed. Here, the physical characteristics of the component parts can be modeled by combining the physical characteristic value of a lumped constant, for example, a distribution amount accumulation characteristics such as elasticity and inductance, a difference amount accumulation characteristic such as mass and conductance, and the loss characteristic.', 'However, depending on the component parts, accumulation characteristics and loss characteristics are distributed throughout the parts, and some parts are difficult to model as lumped constant characteristics.

"A fluorescent lamp emits visible light and infrared light, which causes the following problem. That is, when a remote manipulator (remote controller) which comprises (i) a transmitter that transmits infrared signals of high frequencies and (ii) a receiver that receives such infrared signals is manipulated nearby a display apparatus, faulty operation occurs in the receiver (light receiving section) of the remote manipulator. The transmitter of the remote manipulator is, for example, a remote controller by which the display apparatus is operated, and the light receiving section is, for example, an infrared reception sensor provided in a body of the display apparatus.', 'Now, the principle of the faulty operation in the light receiving section is explained. FIG. 12 is a graph showing the sensitivity of a common infrared reception sensor (light receiving section), and specifically showing a relationship between a wavelength of infrared light and sensitivity of the light receiving section. As shown in FIG. 12, the light receiving section receives infrared light whose wavelength is in a particular range.', 'FIG. 13 is a graph showing an example of a profile of intensity (IR intensity) of infrared light with a wavelength of 912 nm emitted from a display apparatus, i.e. infrared light emitted from fluorescent lamps via a display panel, versus time. FIG. 14 is a graph showing an example of a profile of intensity (IR intensity) of infrared light with a wavelength of 965 nm emitted from a display apparatus versus time. Note that FIGS. 13 and 14 also show the properties changing with temperature changes. As shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, it is clear that the IR intensity is great especially when a wavelength of infrared light emitted from the display apparatus is 912 nm. Further, the intensity of infrared light decreases with time. For this reason, the intensity is the greatest immediately after the display apparatus is turned on and under the like circumstances.', 'As described above, the range of a wavelength of infrared light that the light receiving section can receive overlaps that of a wavelength of infrared light emitted from the display apparatus. This causes infrared light emitted from the display apparatus to be received by the light receiving section, which results in the occurrence of the above-described faulty operation. Such faulty operation in the light receiving section causes the user of the display apparatus to feel that the display apparatus is less responsive to the remote controller, and also causes the failure in execution of a user-specified manipulation.', 'The present invention has been attained in view of the above problem, and an object of the present invention is to provide a backlight control device which can reduce the occurrence of the faulty operation in an infrared-based apparatus, and a display apparatus including the backlight control device.', 'In order to solve the above problem, a backlight control device according to the present invention is a backlight control device which provides PWM control inverters with PWM signals generated in accordance with a dimming level input through a light receiving section that receives infrared light, the inverters causing lamps that emit visible light and infrared light to illuminate, the backlight control device including: a phase adjusting section that changes a phase difference between a first PWM signal for driving a first lamp group and a second PWM signal for driving a second lamp group according to the dimming level when the dimming level is at least in a predetermined range of all dimming levels, the first and second lamp groups each including at least one lamp.', 'As described previously, it is known that the faulty operation in the light receiving section is caused by its reception of infrared light emitted from lamps, which light is different from target infrared light transmitted from an operating section. Further, an experiment described later proved that the faulty operation in the light receiving section occurs when a dimming level of the lamps is in a particular range, and occurs due to difference in phase difference between separate PWM signals by which separate lamp groups are respectively driven.', 'According to the arrangement of the present invention, a phase difference between the first PWM signal for driving the first lamp group and the second PWM signal for driving the second lamp group is changed according to a dimming level. This makes it possible to change the phase difference according to a dimming level so that the infrared light emitted from the lamps is not received by the light receiving section. This eliminates the possibility that the light receiving section receives infrared light emitted from the lamps, which reduces the occurrence of the faulty operation in the light receiving section. This enables the light receiving section to accurately receive the user-specified operation and then execute the corresponding processing.', 'Note that the predetermined range refers to a range in which the faulty operation occurs in the light receiving section due to the effect of infrared light emitted from the lamps.', 'The backlight control device is preferably arranged such that the phase adjusting section sets the phase difference between the first and second PWM signals to be 180° at a dimming level outside the predetermined range.', 'According to the above arrangement, the phase difference between the first and second PWM signals is set to be 180° at a dimming level outside the predetermined range, which enables shortening of the entire lamp flashing period. This makes it possible to reduce the occurrence of the faulty operation in the light receiving section and to suppress interference between a display panel and a backlight.', 'The above backlight control device is preferably arranged such that the dimming level and the phase difference are previously associated with each other in a table, and the phase adjusting section shifts respective phases of the first and second PWM signals in accordance with the phase difference obtained with reference to the table.', 'It is preferable that the backlight control device further includes: a memory section having a table stored therein, the table having (i) the dimming level input through the light receiving section, (ii) a duty ratio corresponding to the dimming level, and (iii) the phase difference between the first and second PWM signals corresponding to the dimming level, wherein (i), (ii), and (iii) are associated with each other; a duty ratio obtaining section referencing the table and obtaining the duty ratio corresponding to the input dimming level; a phase difference obtaining section referencing the table and obtaining the phase difference corresponding to the input dimming level; and a PWM signal generating section generating the first and second PWM signals in accordance with the duty ratio obtained by the duty ratio obtaining section, wherein the phase difference adjusting section sets the phase difference between the first and second PWM signals, both of which are generated by the PWM signal generating section, to be the phase difference obtained by the phase difference obtaining section.', 'According to the above arrangement, the phase difference corresponding to the dimming level can be obtained with reference to the preset table. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of the above-described faulty operation with a simple structure.', 'A display apparatus of the present invention includes: a display panel; and a backlight device irradiating the display panel with light, wherein the backlight device includes any one of the backlight control devices.', 'A display apparatus of the present invention includes any one of the backlight control devices in the backlight device irradiating light with the display panel, which enables reducing the occurrence of the faulty operation in the light receiving section.', 'Additional objects, features, and strengths of the present invention will be made clear by the description below. Further, the advantages of the present invention will be evident from the following explanation in reference to the drawings.",2
"According to the centrifugal fan of the aspect described in (A), since a length from the leading edge end section of the primary wing section to the leading edge of the auxiliary wing section is extended from the intake side in the direction of the central axis of rotation toward the support section, a wing length of the auxiliary wing section at a downstream side (a side of a support section) of a main stream of a flow can be extended while inflow resistance of the intake side is reduced. Thus, air blowing efficiency can be improved.', 'In other words, since the leading edge of the auxiliary wing section is inclined from an upstream side in a suction direction of air toward a downstream side, a way of applying mechanical energy applied to the air to suction the air can be gradually increased from the upstream side toward the downstream. Thus, noise according to separation or disturbance of the air can be suppressed compared with a structure for abruptly applying large mechanical energy to the air from the upstream side as in related art. Therefore, according to the centrifugal fan, air blowing efficiency can be improved compared with the related art while operational sound (noise) is suppressed.', 'Since the thickness of the auxiliary wing section is constant, resistance when the air flows in the leading edge of the blade can be reduced while the thickness of the downstream side (the side of the support section) in which the wing length of the auxiliary wing section is long is prevented from being excessively thicker at the side of the primary wing section. To describe this, for example, when the shape of the auxiliary wing section is tapered toward the leading edge, the thickness of the leading edge should not be made thinner in consideration of the tapered shape formed through injection molding using a mold. For this reason, the thickness of the auxiliary wing section of the side of the primary wing section is increased relative to the leading edge to acquire the tapered shape, but the thickness of the downstream side (the side of the support section) in which the wing length of the auxiliary wing section is particularly long may become excessively thick at the side of the primary wing section of the auxiliary wing section. For this reason, the thickness of the auxiliary wing section needs to be constant.', 'By giving the auxiliary wing section that is thinner relative to the primary wing section a constant thickness, a simple shape when viewed in the direction of the central axis of rotation can be acquired. Thus, a mold is easily manufactured and it can also contribute to lower costs.', 'In the case of (B), since a step difference or a bent section is not formed between the pressure surface of the auxiliary wing section and the pressure surface of the primary wing section, an air flow sent from the auxiliary wing section toward the primary wing section flows smoothly. Thus, air blowing efficiency and noise reduction can be further improved.', 'In the case of (C), since the auxiliary wing section extends in the tangential direction of the pressure surface of the primary wing section so that the pressure surface of the auxiliary wing section and the pressure surface of the primary wing section can be smoothly connected to each other, the operational sound (noise) can be further suppressed without generating disturbance of the flow at the connected portion.', 'In the case of (D), the auxiliary wing section having a small thickness and arranged more densely than the side of the trailing edge of the primary wing section is linearly formed so that a mold is more easily manufactured than when formed in a curved shape and it can contribute to lower costs.', 'In the case of (E), the auxiliary wing section having a small thickness and arranged more densely than the side of the trailing edge of the primary wing section is linearly formed so that a mold is more easily manufactured than when formed in a curved shape and it can contribute to lower costs.', 'In the case of (F), the air blowing efficiency can be improved to a greater level while the operational sound (noise) is suppressed to a lesser level.', 'In the case of (G), occurrence of vortexes or occurrence of separation of the air from the surfaces of the blades in the air flowing between the blades can be suppressed to the minimum. Thus, noise caused by the vortexes or the separation of the air from the blades can be reduced. Energy loss caused by the vortexes or the separation of the air from the blades can also be suppressed to the minimum to improve the air blowing efficiency.', 'In the case of (H), the leading edge of the auxiliary wing section is formed in a concave or convex curved shape viewed from the side so that it is possible to flexibly cope with an acquired specification of the centrifugal fan.', 'In the case of (I), the shroud itself can connect the blades to each other to reinforce a support state of the blades and define an inflow area (a flow path) of the air flowing in.",1

"A vane as a first aspect according to the present invention to achieve the above object is a vane of a gas turbine in which a plurality of vanes are disposed in an array in a circumferential direction around a rotor shaft, the vane including:', 'a vane body that is disposed inside a combustion gas flow passage through which combustion gas flows, and that extends in a radial direction of the rotor shaft; and', 'a shroud that is formed at an end of the vane body in the radial direction and defines a part of the combustion gas flow passage, wherein', 'the shroud has a gas path surface that faces the radial direction and comes in contact with the combustion gas, a pair of circumferential end surfaces that face opposite sides in the circumferential direction, a cavity into which cooling air flows, and a plurality of circumferential blowout passages that communicate with the cavity and open in the circumferential end surface,', 'the circumferential end surface has a central region that is a region located inside a throat circle being a circle with a minimum radius of circles in contact with both the vane body of the vane and a vane body of another vane adjacent to the vane in the circumferential direction, an upstream-side region that is located further on an upstream side of the combustion gas flow passage than the central region, and a downstream-side region that is located on the opposite side of the central region from the upstream side, and openings of the plurality of circumferential blowout passages are formed at least in the central region, and', 'a density that is the number of the openings of the circumferential blowout passages per unit length in an axial direction in which the rotor shaft extends is higher in the central region than in the upstream-side region and the downstream-side region.', 'Tests etc. have confirmed that the central region of the circumferential end surface of the shroud reaches a higher temperature than the upstream-side region and the downstream-side region of the circumferential end surface. In this vane, therefore, cooling air is blown out at least from the central region of the circumferential end surface of the shroud to intensively cool this central region. Thus, thermal damage to the central region can be reduced in this vane. On the other hand, the temperatures of the upstream-side region and the downstream-side region of the circumferential end surface are lower than the temperature of the central region. In this vane, therefore, the density of the openings of the circumferential blowout passages is set to be lower in the upstream-side region and the downstream-side region than in the central region.', 'Thus, according to this vane, it is possible to efficiently use cooling air so as to improve the durability of the vane and at the same time reduce the amount of cooling air used.', 'A vane as a second aspect according to the present invention to achieve the above object is the vane of the first aspect, wherein the density of the openings of the circumferential blowout passages in the upstream-side region and the downstream-side region is zero.', 'According to this vane, cooling air can be used more efficiently.', 'A vane as a third aspect according to the present invention to achieve the above object is the vane of the first or second aspect, wherein: of the pair of circumferential end surfaces, one circumferential end surface forms a pressure-side end surface that is on a pressure side of the vane body in the circumferential direction, and the other circumferential end surface forms a suction-side end surface that is on a suction side of the vane body in the circumferential direction; and the density of the openings of the plurality of circumferential blowout passages is higher in the pressure-side end surface than in the suction-side end surface.', 'A vane as a fourth aspect according to the present invention to achieve the above object is the vane of the third aspect, wherein the density of the openings of the circumferential blowout passages in the suction-side end surface is zero.', 'Tests etc. have confirmed that a vane can be cooled most efficiently when the openings of the plurality of circumferential blowout passages are formed only in the pressure-side end surface. Thus, according to the above vane, the vane can be efficiently cooled.', 'A vane as a fifth aspect according to the present invention to achieve the above object is the vane of any one of the first to fourth aspects, wherein: each of the pair of circumferential end surfaces has a seal groove formed therein in which a seal plate that seals a gap between the shroud of the vane and the shroud of another vane adjacent to the vane in the circumferential direction is mounted; and the openings of the plurality of circumferential blowout passages are formed on a side closer to the seal groove than to the gas path surface in the radial direction.', 'Cooling air having flowed out of the circumferential blowout passages diffuses gradually as it approaches the gas path surface. In this vane, the openings of the circumferential blowout passages are formed in the circumferential end surface of the shroud, on the side closer to the seal groove than to the gas path surface in the radial direction. Accordingly, in this vane, cooling air has diffused more widely at the point when the cooling air reaches the gas path surface than if the openings of the circumferential blowout passages are formed in the circumferential end surface of the shroud, on the side closer to the gas path surface than to the seal groove in the radial direction.

Moreover, in this vane, regions of diffusion of the currents of the cooling air flowing out of the plurality of circumferential blowout passages overlap one another at the point when the cooling air reaches the gas path surface.

"In order to address the above challenges, we contemplated applying three-dimensional atom probe (3DAP) microscopy to the analysis of a modified layer formed immediately under an epitaxial layer. 3DAP microscopy makes it possible to achieve a higher resolution than that achieved by SIMS, and to perform three-dimensional mapping/analysis in addition to the observation of a cross section of a surface which is performed by TEM. Accordingly, we contemplated analyzing the modified layer by 3DAP microscopy to obtain a three-dimensional map with respect to carbon or a three-dimensional map with respect to an impurity of interest.', 'We thus found the following. First, immediately after the formation of a modified layer by carbon ion implantation, even if the implanted ions are cluster ions, carbon atoms are uniformly distributed in the modified layer. When heat treatment is performed after the ion implantation, carbon atoms are found to be aggregated to form aggregates particularly in a region of 200 nm from the surface layer of the modified layer. Impurities to be gettered are found to segregate in and around the carbon aggregates in the modified layer.

"In manufacturing of light-emitting devices, a reflow process is generally performed to mount LEDs on a board. Application of heat to the board in this reflow process may cause the board to expand.', 'In this case, the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of a mounting surface of the board on which LEDs are mounted and an attaching surface to which the device body is attached causes warpage and distortion of the board. This deteriorates the adhesion between the board and the device body. As a result, the heat conduction from the LEDs to the device body is inhibited, and an abnormal increase in temperature of the LEDs is induced. When several LEDs are connected in parallel above the mounting surface of the board, temperature rise is caused for each of the LEDs connected in parallel. However, the levels of temperature rise differ between the LEDs. This causes variation in current characteristics and voltage characteristics, and thus causes variation in a current between parallel-connection paths.', 'The variation in a current between parallel-connection paths as mentioned above causes variation in brightness of luminescence between the parallel-connection paths and variation in life of the LEDs. Especially, internal resistance of the LEDs decreases as temperature rises in the LEDs. Therefore, a current concentrates on a specific path having the lowest internal resistance, and the temperature in the LEDs further increases. As a result, the specific internal path has a life shorter than those of other paths, and only the LEDs in the specific path stop emitting light.', 'The present invention has been conceived in order to solve the problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a light-emitting device and a lighting apparatus which can equalize the rise in temperature of light-emitting elements connected in parallel.",2

The running of the drum may be performed by performing reverse rotation and forward rotation of the driving motor in a sequential manner, and the turning on of the heat pump system may be started after forward rotation of the driving motor.', 'With the configuration, prior to turning the heat pump system on, the drum may be run by the driving motor so as to allow loads to be sequentially started.', 'In the meantime, the method may further include determining whether or not a compressor included in the heat pump system normally operates. The turning on of the heater may be performed after checking the heat pump system is normally turned on. The determining of whether or not the compressor normally operates may be performed by comparing a temperature variation of a refrigerant having passed through the compressor with a preset reference temperature variation.', 'With the configuration, in the dryer having the heat pump system and the heater, the heater may be turned on after the normal operation of the heat pump system is checked. That is, when the heater is turned on in a state that the compressor does not normally operate due to an existence of error, air heated by the heater may flows through the condenser of the heat pump system, which may result in erroneous heat transfer in the condenser. Accordingly, a refrigerant of high temperature may be introduced into the compressor, thereby further deteriorating the state of the compressor.', 'Therefore, the heater may be turned on after checking that the compressor normally operates, thus to prevent an introduction of a refrigerant of high temperature or a refrigerant in a liquid phase into the compressor.', 'Here, those steps may be performed right after the compressor is started during the drying operation. That is, when an auxiliary heater is needed to be run even after checking whether the compressor normally operates at the beginning, the heat may be turned on after checking whether the compressor normally operates, thereby preventing damage of the compressor.', 'Here, whether or not the compressor normally operates may be determined by measuring discharge pressure of the compressor. That is, if heat transfer is not properly performed in the compressor, the discharge pressure of the compressor may be raised due to the refrigerant of high temperature. Therefore, the discharge pressure may be checked by use of a pressure sensor or the like so as to determine whether the compressor normally operates.', 'Whether or not the compressor normally operates may also be checked by measuring a temperature of a refrigerant discharged from the compressor. That is, the temperature of the refrigerant is not high at the beginning of running the compressor, but as the compressor is running to reach its normal state, the temperature of the refrigerant increases. Therefore, the temperature of the refrigerant may be detected to check whether the compressor normally operates according to a temperature variation of the refrigerant. To this end, the determining of whether or not the compressor normally operates may include measuring a temperature Ti of a refrigerant discharged from the compressor, measuring a temperature T2 of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor after a predetermined time from the measurement of T1, and determining whether or not the compressor normally operates according to a difference between T1 and T2.', 'Here, when the difference value of T2−T1 is greater than a predetermined value, it may be determined that the compressor normally operates. The step may further include stopping power supply to the compressor and displaying an existence of error on the dryer when the difference value of T2−T1 is smaller than the predetermined value.",0

"The lip seal according to the present invention has the configuration in which the ring-shaped pressure regulation chamber is formed using the elastic arm part and the flexible wall as partition walls, so that the flexible wall is deformed by increase or decrease in pressure in the pressure regulation chamber.

"However, in progressive addition lens having a free curved surface of individualized design, characteristics in lens design generally differ according to the lens design standard applied. This means that characteristics of lens visual performance differ according to the lens design standard applied. Namely, due to characteristics of lens visual performance differing according to the lens design standard applied, what it is like to look through the spectacle lens also differs. What it is like to look through the spectacle lens is also different between respective areas, called a far vision area, a near vision area, an intermediate vision area, and the like. Thus when a simulation device is utilized, not only is it important for a prospective spectacle lens wearer who experiences a simulation of a lens wearing state to be informed of, and given sufficient understanding of, the differences in characteristics in the lens visual performance of the spectacle lens, but determining suitability based on the result of simulated experience is also extremely important to giving the prospective spectacle lens wearer a feeling of satisfaction.', 'Thus even though conventional simulation devices are able to give a prospective spectacle lens wearer a simulated experience of looking through a spectacle lens, it cannot be said that the prospective spectacle lens wearer is always given sufficiently able to ascertain the differences in characteristics of lens visual performance for each of the spectacle lenses. For example, in the case of a progressive addition lens having a free curved surface of individualized design, several hundreds of sorts of design type are achieved by combination of the lens visual performance characteristics of each of the lenses. Thus there is a concern that it might not be possible to accurately notify and give understanding to the prospective spectacle lens wearer regarding which characteristics of lens visual performance the spectacle lens selected by the prospective spectacle lens wearer possesses, unless there is a member of staff who sufficiently understands the differences in characteristics between the respective several hundreds of sorts of design type achieved. Namely, in order to explain the characteristics of the lens visual performance of the spectacle lens that has been selected by the prospective spectacle lens wearer, a high level of skill in understanding lens design and in explaining is required in the member of staff of the spectacle shop. Thus, depending on the skills of the member of staff, it might not be possible to give a prospective spectacle lens wearer sufficient understanding of the characteristics of lens visual performance of the spectacle lens, and, as a result, the prospective spectacle lens wearer might feel dissatisfied.', 'Moreover, there is a conventional simulation device in which configuration is made such that the simulation image is displayed on a display screen of a head mounted display (HMD) when having a prospective spectacle lens wearer check a simulation image by sight (see, for example, Patent Document 1). However, when giving a simulated experience of a lens wearing state using a HMD, there are few HMDs capable of reproducing the full visual field of the spectacle lens with clarity, and those capable of reproducing the full visual field with clarity have a high cost for introduction into spectacle shops, and, because of such aspects as their size and weight, are also a burden on the prospective spectacle lens wearers. Moreover, although there are compact, lightweight, low cost HMDs, such HMDs have a limited visual field, and are not sufficient for performing simulation at high resolution. Thus it is possible that conventional simulation devices do not only feel unsatisfactory to the prospective spectacle lens wearers, but also to the spectacle shop side.', 'Thus an object of the present invention is to provide a simulation system, a simulation device, and a product explanation assistance method that are capable of eliminating the dissatisfaction described above, for the prospective spectacle lens wearer, spectacle shop side, etc., when a prospective spectacle lens wearer is given a simulated experience of a lens wearing state.",2

There is another problem in that because a measurable communication lag time is only an average of lag times in the two communication channels, the resulting measurement of the lag times is inaccurate. The conventional technique also suffers from a further problem in that the delay times caused by the relay/reload processing in the slave stations are not accurately obtained.', 'The present disclosure advantageously provides timer synchronization between a master station and slave stations with a high degree of accuracy while reducing costs associated with communication channels through which the master and slave stations are connected.",2

"If two planetary gear sets are arranged such that one of the two planetary gear sets is disposed radially inward from the other, a carrier X of the radially outer planetary gear set PGb of the two planetary gear sets rotatably supports a pinion of the radially outer planetary gear set PGb, as illustrated in FIG. 18. This pinion is disposed radially outward from a sun gear Y integrated with a ring gear of the radially inner planetary gear set PGa, and accordingly, the diameter of the carrier X is larger than those of the carriers of the other planetary gear sets (in particular, the radially inner planetary gear set PGa).', 'As a result, the support for the carrier X (and the pinion supported by the carrier X) of the radially outer planetary gear set PGb becomes unstable, and accordingly, the support for a ring gear with a larger diameter disposed radially outward from the pinion also becomes unstable. Consequently, the rotation axes of the carrier X, the pinion, and the ring gear radially outward from the pinion tend to be tilted with respect to the axial direction of the automatic transmission without extending in that direction. If the radially outer planetary gear set PGb is driven in such a tilted state, gear mesh failure is caused in the radially outer planetary gear set PGb. This may cause, e.g., gear noise and a decrease in durability of the gears, which are problems.', 'In view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an automatic transmission having a new configuration that allows for, even if a two-stage planetary gear set is formed by arranging two planetary gear sets such that one of the two planetary gear sets is disposed radially inward from the other to reduce the axial length of the automatic transmission, stably supporting a carrier, pinion, and ring gear of the radially outer planetary gear set of the two-stage planetary gear set.",2

Also, because polyolefins obtained using a metallocene catalyst have extremely low levels of low-molecular-weight components and low-crystallinity components, they have an excellent cleanliness, and can thus be regarded as highly suitable for food and medical-related applications.', 'On the other hand, there is a possibility that, in this state, such polyolefins will have an inadequate low-temperature impact resistance.', 'Accordingly, the present invention provides multilayer sheets which are endowed with excellent flexibility, transparency, impact resistance, heat resistance and cleanliness, and are also capable of withstanding harsh heat-sealing conditions during bag-making.

"On the other hand, in recent years, in order to realize image formation or manufacturing of wiring with higher definition, it is desirable to decrease the pitch between nozzles or to decrease the pitch between wirings. If the pitch between the nozzles or the pitch between the wirings decreases, accordingly, the pitch between the terminals of the piezoelectric elements or between the terminals of various elements decreases. However, in the liquid droplet ejecting head described in JP-A-2006-281763, since the surface on which the wirings are formed is one lateral surface of the reservoir forming substrate, a minimum portion of the pitch between the wirings is the same as the pitch between the terminals of the piezoelectric elements. For this reason, if the pitch between the terminals of the piezoelectric elements decreases, there is a problem in that it is difficult to form the wirings.', 'An advantage of some aspects of the invention is to provide a wiring structure and a method of manufacturing a wiring structure capable of facilitating formation of wirings even if the pitch between a plurality of terminals decreases in a wiring structure in which the plurality of terminals on a base substrate and the wirings on a wiring substrate bonded to the base substrate are electrically connected, and a liquid droplet ejecting head and a liquid droplet ejecting apparatus including the wiring structure.",2

"The shapes along the circling directions of the conventional tolerance rings described in Patent Literatures 1 to 4 are elastically deformable to approximately circular shapes nearly equal to the openings of the carriages. In practice, however, the curvature radius of the tolerance ring is designed larger than the curvature radius of the opening of the carriage because the tolerance ring needs to be held inside the carriage for the sake of assembly operation. In addition, the curvature radiuses of end portions of the tolerance ring are larger than the curvature radius of the opening of the carriage in some cases because the end portion side of the tolerance ring is opened for the sake of manufacturing processes. As a result, the shape along the circling direction of the elastically deformed tolerance ring has an elliptical shape when the tolerance ring is inserted into the opening of the carriage. This results in the major axis of the ellipse being larger than the diameter of the opening of the carriage, and the tolerance ring may rub and damage the side surface of the carriage when being inserted into the opening of the carriage. As a result, the tolerance ring rubs and damages the inside of the hole of the carriage, and a problem arises in that this causes the occurrence of contamination.

"However, the processes for determining acceptable transmit power of the centralized-type and autonomous distributed-type described in PTL 1 have the following problems, respectively.', 'First, in the case of the centralized-type, the database DB calculates acceptable transmit power for each secondary transmitting station. This calculation is required each time a secondary transmitting station Ts makes a change in the state of frequency use. For example, supposing that a new secondary transmitting station Ts begins to share a frequency, a request to use a frequency from the secondary transmitting station Ts is notified to the database DB via its spectrum manager SM. At this time, the database DB calculates acceptable transmit power for the new secondary transmitting station Ts and for other secondary transmitting stations Ts sharing the frequency such that the new secondary transmitting station Ts can newly start transmission at this frequency while the primary receiving station can maintain predetermined reception quality. Similarly, when a secondary transmitting station Ts stops using this frequency as well, it is preferable to recalculate acceptable transmit power and thereby adjust gross interference caused by those secondary transmitting stations Ts that are currently performing transmission. However, if the total number of secondary transmitting stations that can use this frequency increases, changes in the state of frequency use such as start and stop of frequency use frequently occur and at each of such times, the database DB calculates acceptable transmit power. Consequently, processing load is concentrated on the database DB.', 'On the other hand, in the case of the autonomous distributed-type, there is a possibility that the calculation of acceptable transmit power by each spectrum manager overlaps with the other\'s, resulting in redundant calculation processing. Assume that a plurality of primary receiving stations Rp (here, Rp1, Rp2, and Rp3) exist within the service area of a primary transmitting station Tp (primary system service area), as shown in FIG. 1. The acceptable transmit power of the secondary transmitting stations Ts needs to be determined by taking into consideration the interference from each secondary transmitting station Ts on each primary receiving station Rp, so that all of the primary receiving stations Rp can maintain predetermined reception quality. Assuming that P(n) is the acceptable transmit power of an n-th (1≦n≦N) secondary transmitting station (this acceptable transmit power is assumed to be equivalent isotopically radiated power with antenna gain factored in), interference Im suffered by an m-th primary receiving station (1≦m≦M) can be expressed by the following mathematical expression (1).', ",2

Basically, one bullet is shot from each one of the barrels at a time. That is, the basic point of shooting one bullet from one barrel is in common with the cases of electric guns in the related art. However, it is possible to change the number of bullets to be loaded in the barrels, as disclosed in the invention of JP-A-2013-83403. Therefore, when the configuration is applied to the present invention, it is technically possible to shoot a plurality of bullets from one barrel.', 'The electric gun according to the present invention includes the electric-type compressed air generating unit for blasting each bullet with air. As the compressed air generating unit, the present invention includes the cylinder assembly, the piston assembly, and the electric mechanism. The cylinder assembly and the piston assembly are combined and configure the piston cylinder mechanism, and the electric mechanism drives the piston assembly.', 'The cylinder assembly is constituted by the plurality of cylinders which are each positioned at rear portions of the plurality of barrels, in each of which the piston reciprocates, and each of which has the air-blast nozzle at the tip end. As an apparatus of the present invention, it is preferable that the cylinder assembly is configured to have the plurality of cylinders, a front fixing member fixing each of the cylinders to a tip end portion, and a rear fixing member fixing each of the cylinders to a rear end portion.

Accordingly, the plurality of pistons are caused to reciprocate by one piston shaft. Since the pressures generated inside the plurality of cylinders are independent from each other and are approximately uniform at all times, even if any one of the barrels is clogged, there is no change in pressure of the remaining barrels.', 'The cylinder assembly is configured to have a plurality of pipe members, a front fixing member fixing each of the pipe members to a tip end portion, and a rear fixing member fixing each of the pipe members to a rear end portion.

"Moreover, when a steel sheet is subjected to cold plastic deformation, the strength of the steel sheet can be increased by work hardening. Hence, cold plastic deformation is performed on a Nb-added steel sheet to cause work hardening, increasing the strength of the steel sheet, and furthermore, hardening treatment is performed on the steel sheet surface. This makes it possible to harden the surface layer while suppressing softening of work hardening of the sheet-thickness central portion.', 'According to research by the inventors, the following facts have been found. In the case where an amount of working through plastic deformation is large and a work hardening rate is high, softening of the sheet-thickness central portion can be suppressed by performing thermal treatment on the Nb-added steel sheet. In the case where an amount of working is small and a work hardening rate is low, softening of the sheet-thickness central portion cannot be suppressed even if thermal treatment is performed on the Nb-added steel sheet.', 'For example, when automobile parts are produced, after a steel sheet is subjected to cold working by press forming or the like, the surface is subjected to softnitriding in some cases. Here, since automobile parts have various shapes, when the steel sheet is subjected to press working, an area with a relatively large amount of working and an area with a relatively small amount of working occur in one part. Here, in the case where a Nb-containing steel sheet is used, thermal treatment in softnitriding may soften the strength of the sheet-thickness central portion in an area with a relatively small amount of working, causing insufficiency in the strength of the part.', 'Hence, in view of such circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a hot-rolled steel sheet, a steel material, and a method for producing a hot-rolled steel sheet that are capable of preventing softening of the strength of a sheet-thickness central portion of the steel sheet in thermal treatment, even in the case where an amount of working performed on the steel sheet is small and a work hardening rate is low.",2
"In order to solve the foregoing problems, the present invention provides a work machine including an travel base, a work machine body attached on the travel base, a work front attached to the work machine body swingably in an up/down direction, and a control device for controlling drive of each of these portions, wherein: the control device includes: a stabilization control calculation unit which predicts a change in stability until each movable portion in the travel base, the work machine body and the work front stops in accordance with a change in an operating velocity of a control lever for operating the drive of the movable portion when the control lever in an operating state is brought back to a stop command position, and which calculates a motion limit needed to keep the work machine stable until the movable portion stops; and a command value generating unit which corrects command information to an actuator driving the movable portion, based on a result of the calculation of the stabilization control calculation unit, so that stability of the machine can be improved even when the control lever in the operating state is instantaneously brought back to the stop position.', 'According to this configuration, in the case where the control lever in the operating state is instantaneously brought back to the neutral position, the stabilization control calculation unit predicts a change in stability until each movable portion in the work machine completely stops and calculates a motion limit needed to keep the work machine stable at any time instant until each movable portion in the work machine completely stops, and the command value generating unit corrects command information to the actuator based on a result of the calculation. Thus, the stability of the work machine in an environment where inertia acts on the work machine can be evaluated accurately so that static and dynamic balance can be kept stably in the work machine. In addition, driving the actuator is controlled in consideration of the influence in the case where the control lever in the operating state is instantaneously brought back to the neutral position, that is, in the case where each movable portion in the work machine is stopped suddenly. Thus, the work machine can be prevented from tipping due to the sudden stop of the travel base or a front member as well as due to the sudden stop of the upperstructure. Further, in this case, the prediction of the change in stability and the calculation of the motion limit can be performed by a simple arithmetic operation. Thus, processing for stabilizing the work machine can be performed in real time.', 'In addition, according to the invention, there is provided a work machine in the aforementioned configuration, wherein: the stabilization control calculation unit calculates, as the motion limit, at least one of a slow stop command value for limiting deceleration of the movable portion to stop the movable portion slowly and a motion velocity upper limit for limiting a motion velocity of the actuator.', 'Generally, each movable portion in the work machine is driven in accordance with the contents of operation on the control lever. Accordingly, when the control lever in the operating state is instantaneously brought back to the neutral position, the movable portion driven in accordance with the operation on the control lever stops suddenly, and inertia occurs in accordance with deceleration at that time. Accordingly, even when the control lever in the operating state is instantaneously brought back to the neutral position, the inertia acting on the movable portion can be relaxed so that the work machine can be kept stable if deceleration of the movable portion is limited or the motion velocity of the actuator is limited in advance.', 'In addition, according to the invention, there is provided a work machine in the aforementioned configuration, wherein: the stabilization control calculation unit calculates the motion limit using at least one of ZMP coordinates calculated from position information, acceleration information and external force information as to each movable portion in the travel base, the work machine body and the work front, and mechanical energy calculated from position information and velocity information as to each movable portion of the work machine.', 'The ZMP (Zero Moment Point) coordinates are coordinates of a point of application in which a normal component of a floor reaction force applied to and distributed all over the portion where a structure is grounded on the ground surface is regarded as a component applied to a certain point. In addition, a ZMP stability determination creterion is based on the d\'Alembert\'s principle, in which the ZMP coordinates are used as an evaluation index for determining the stability of the structure. When the ZMP coordinates exist inside a support polygon drawn by surrounding the grounded portion of the structure so as not to be concave (convex hull), it is determined that the structure is stably grounded on the ground surface. When the ZMP coordinates exist on a side of the support polygon, it is determined that the grounded portion of the structure is partially on the boundary where the grounded portion is about to float up from the ground surface. According to the ZMP stabilization determination rule, the stability of the structure can be evaluated in a quantitative way, while the existence of the possibility of tipping can be determined accurately. On the other hand, as for the mechanical energy, the structure is regarded as an inverted pendulum having a support on the support polygon when a part of the structure floats up. When the center of gravity in the structure arrives on a vertical line from the rotational center (ZMP) thereof, the structure overturns due to its own action of gravity. By use of this fact, whether the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy of the structure exceeds the potential energy at the highest point or not is calculated so that it can be determined whether the structure whose grounded portion partially floats up from the ground surface will overturn or not. In this manner, by use of these methods, it is possible to accurately determine the stability and the possibility of tipping of the work machine.', 'In addition, according to the invention, there is provided a work machine in the aforementioned configuration, wherein: the stabilization control calculation unit stores a limit of deceleration of the movable portion in advance, and corrects the command information to the actuator so as to satisfy the limit of the deceleration.', 'According to this configuration, the stabilization control calculation unit stores the limit of deceleration of the movable portion in advance. Thus, the command information to the actuator can be corrected easily based on the stored limit of the deceleration of the movable portion so that processing for stabilizing the work machine can be performed in real time.', 'In addition, according to the invention, there is provided a work machine in the aforementioned configuration, wherein: the control device includes a behavior predicting unit for predicting behavior of the work machine in the case where the control lever in the operating state is instantaneously brought back to the stop command position; and the behavior predicting unit uses, as a model, a cubic function whose extreme values correspond to a velocity change start point expressed by a time instant when velocity starts to change and the velocity at that time instant, and a peak arrival point expressed by a time instant when an amount of change in velocity is the highest since release of the control lever and the velocity at that time instant, and uses an overshoot rate calculated based on the rate between velocity at the velocity change start point and velocity at the peak arrival point identified in advance for each motion of the travel base, the work machine body and the work front, a period of time between the release of the control lever and the velocity change start point, and a period of time between the velocity change start point and the peak arrival point.', 'In order to predict the behavior of the movable portion which is operated by the control lever and stopped suddenly when the control lever in the operating state is instantaneously brought back to the stop command position, it is necessary to calculate the position, velocity and acceleration loci of the movable portion until the movable portion completely stops. In this case, when the locus of the velocity at the sudden stop is modeled by a simple cubic function model, the loci of the position, the velocity and the acceleration at the sudden stop can be calculated easily. Thus, the behavior at the sudden stop can be predicted in real time.",0

"(1) In the ignition operation actuator as described in the first aspect, a cam is used in the motion conversion mechanism configured to convert rotation of the motor into a linear motion of the press button.

With this configuration, a return movement of the press button which is caused by the spring can be smoothly performed.', '(6) In the ignition operation actuator as described in the sixth aspect, the operation section is mounted to a fixed frame fixed to a seat of a vehicle through an arm. With this configuration, even if there is a play in a steering wheel, displacement of a center point of pressing of the press button can be suppressed.', '(7) In the ignition operation actuator as described in the seventh aspect, the operation section can be more certainly held in place by an arm of a fixed frame fixed to a seat of a vehicle and a fixture.', '(8) In the ignition operation actuator as described in the eighth aspect, the operation section can be sucked and fixed to an interior surface of a vehicle by means of a suction cup even if a free guide arm or the like is not used.",1

"(Example of Change of the Refresh Rate by a Conventional Display Device)', 'An example of change of the refresh rate by a conventional display device is described here with reference to FIG. 5.

Of (a) to (c) of FIG. 5, (a) of FIG. 5 shows a time of normal driving. Further, (b) of FIG. 5 shows a time of change of the refresh rate (to 1/2 of the refresh rate during normal driving). Further, (c) of FIG. 5 shows a time of change of the refresh rate (to 1/3 of the refresh rate during normal driving).', 'Meanwhile, in (a) to (c) of FIG. 5, Vsync represents the pulse waveform of a vertical synchronization signal that is generated every frame period. Further, Vg(0) represents the pulse waveform of a drive pulse on the first (leading) gate signal line. Further, Vg(m) represents the pulse waveform of a drive pulse on the mth gate signal line. Moreover, Vg(M) represents the pulse waveform of a drive pulse on the Mth (last) gate signal line.', 'The example shown in FIG. 5 is a case where the refresh rate of a display panel is changed by a conventional display device by providing frame periods (hereinafter referred to as “pause periods”) during which the plurality of gate signal lines are not scanned.', 'For example, during normal driving (i.e. driving of the display panel at the standard refresh rate) in the conventional display device, there is provided a continuous series of frame periods (hereinafter referred to as “scan periods”) during which the plurality of gate signal lines are scanned (see (a) of FIG. 5). For example, in a case where the refresh rate during normal driving is 60 Hz, there is provided a series of sixty scan periods per second.', 'Moreover, the conventional display device changes some of the frame periods to pause periods in changing the refresh rate. For example, in changing the refresh rate from 60 Hz to 30 Hz, the conventional display device alternates a scan period and a pause period (see (b) of FIG. 5) by changing appropriate ones of the plurality of frame periods during normal driving from scan periods to pause periods so that the ratio of scan periods to pause periods is 1:1. This causes the number of times the plurality of gate signal lines are scanned per second to be 30, thus causing the refresh rate of the display panel to be changed from 60 Hz to 30 Hz.', 'Similarly, in changing the refresh rate from 60 Hz to 20 Hz, the conventional display device alternates a scan period and two pause periods (see (c) of FIG. 5) by changing appropriate ones of the plurality of frame periods during normal driving from scan periods to pause periods so that the ratio of scan periods to pause periods is 1:2. This causes the number of times the plurality of gate signal lines are scanned per second to be 20, thus causing the refresh rate of the display panel to be changed from 60 Hz to 20 Hz.', 'By thus changing the refresh rate by providing pause periods, the period of time required to scan the display panel can be shortened. Moreover, doing so can better reduce electric power consumption than changing the refresh rate by adjusting the length of a scan period.', 'It should be noted here that as shown in (a) to (c) of FIG. 5, there is no difference between the length of a drive period (period during which an ON voltage (Hi level voltage) is applied) of each gate signal line before the change of the refresh rate and that after the change of the refresh rate. On the other hand, there is a difference between the length of a non-drive period (period during which an OFF voltage (Lo level voltage) is applied) of each gate signal line before the change of the refresh rate and that after the change of the refresh rate.', 'For example, in the examples shown in (a) to (c) of FIG. 5, the pulse number of drive pulses on each gate signal line is “1” regardless of the refresh rata, and its pulse width remains fixed.', 'As opposed to this, for example, in the case of the change of the refresh rate to 1/2 (e.g. from 60 Hz to 30 Hz), where a scan period and a pause period are alternated so that the ratio of scan periods to pause periods is 1:1, the length of a non-drive period of each gate signal line is extended to a period equal in length to two pause periods (e.g. 2/60 second).', 'Alternatively, in the case of the change of the refresh rate to 1/3 (e.g. from 60 Hz to 20 Hz), where a scan period and two pause periods are alternated so that the ratio of scan periods to pause periods is 1:2, the length of a non-drive period of each gate signal line is extended to a period equal in length to three pause periods (e.g. 3/60 second).', 'Thus employing a configuration in which the refresh rate is changed by providing pause periods, the conventional display device suffers from fluctuation in duty ratio (hereinafter referred to as “ON/OFF ratio”) between the length of a drive period of each gate signal line and the length of a non-drive period of each gate signal line. Especially in recent years, since there has recently been improvement in the OFF characteristics of the switching elements of pixels and, accordingly, it has become possible to lengthen a pause period, such fluctuation in the ON/OFF ratio has been likely to take place.', 'Further, simply increasing the number of times writing is performed on each gate signal line during scanning, as described in Patent Literature 2, listed above, ends up with fluctuation in the ON/OFF ratio of each gate signal line.', 'Moreover, such fluctuation in the ON/OFF ratio invites fluctuation in threshold voltage of the switching elements constituting the respective pixels.', 'The switching element in each pixel is designed to operate at a predetermined ON voltage and a predetermined OFF voltage when the switching element is made to operate at a predetermined ON/OFF ratio. For this reason, as described above, greatly changing the refresh rate of the display panel or increasing the number of time writing is performed on each gate signal line during scanning causes the ON/OFF ratio of each switching element to be greatly changed, too, thereby causing a variation in threshold voltage of each switching element. This in turn disables each switching element to operate at a predetermined ON voltage and a predetermined OFF voltage.', '(Fluctuations in the Threshold Voltage of a Switching Element)', 'Now, an example of fluctuations in the threshold voltage of a switching element due to fluctuations in the ON/OFF ratio of the switching element is described with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7. FIG. 6 is a diagram showing the characteristics of a switching element that is used in a pixel of a display panel. FIG. 7 is a table showing the ON/OFF ratio of the switching element and the stability of a threshold voltage Vth at each level of image resolution of the display panel. FIGS. 6 and 7 show an example where paused driving as a method of driving.', 'As shown in FIG. 7, in a case where a switching element is used in a display panel of a VGA size (640×480 pixels), the ON/OFF ratio of the switching element is “0.17%”. In this case, as it is shown in FIG. 7 that the stability of the threshold voltage Vth is “Very Good”, the switching element can be made to operate normally.",2

"The present invention creates a terminal which mainly sends and receives mail and which, when mail-related data is executed, breaks a connection with a network, system program, or other part which a virus targets for infection so as to enable display of data without problem even with virus infection, therefore enables secure transfer of mail without taking up the issue of virus infection. It realizes a terminal dedicated to sending/receiving mail, that is, a box-like terminal which realizes security of mail.', 'Further, when execution of a virus program would cause a signal to be output to an I/O port or other input/output part other than one executing mail-related data, when data is stored once in a memory and the destination IP address is searched for and detected, when detecting information which is derived from a packet signal, when a certain threshold value which counts output of a signal trying to send data is exceeded, or when despite there being no need for a program to send information to another party, transmission data is formed and output, sometimes this fact is displayed on a liquid crystal monitor or LED to enable detection of infection by an unknown virus.', 'In this case, sometimes there is no need for a template file for viruses, updating the file also becomes unnecessary, and the configuration is streamlined.",1

"In order to achieve the above-described object, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a turbine wheel including: a disk which has a shape rotationally symmetrical about an axis and a diameter which gradually decreases from a front side which is one side in an axial direction in which the axis extends toward a rear side which is the other side; a plurality of blades which are fixed to an outer peripheral surface of the disk at intervals in a circumferential direction D with respect to the axis, in which each of the blades includes a leading edge which extends in a direction including an axial component from a portion on the front side of the disk and faces a radially outer side with respect to the axis, a trailing edge which extends in a direction including a radial component with respect to the axis from a portion on the rear side of the disk and faces the rear side, a pressure surface and a suction surface which extend from the leading edge to the trailing edge and face sides opposite to each other, a tip which forms an edge on a side far from the outer peripheral surface, the suction surface includes a leading edge side of blade tip including a boundary between the suction surface and the tip and the leading edge and a trailing edge side of blade tip including a boundary between the suction surface and the tip and the trailing edge, the leading edge side of blade tip forms a concave curved surface which is recessed to an counter-rotation side from the suction surface toward the pressure surface when viewed in a radial direction, and the trailing edge side of blade tip forms a convex curved surface which protrudes to a rotation side from the pressure surface toward the suction surface side when viewed in the radial direction.', 'There is a gap referred to as a tip clearance between the tip of the blade in the turbine wheel and an inner peripheral surface of a turbine housing covering the turbine wheel. A flow of a working fluid through the tip clearance, that is, a presence of a clearance flow leads to a decrease in turbine efficiency.', 'Here, a blade in which the entire suction surface is a convex curved surface protruding to the rotation side is defined as Comparative Example. In Comparative Example, as a result of the clearance flow, a leakage fluid which has flowed from a pressure surface side of the blade to a suction surface side becomes a vortex flow, and flows along the suction surface of the blade. The flow of the leakage fluid along the suction surface of the blade attracts the clearance flow.', 'Meanwhile, in the turbine wheel, the leading edge side of blade tip in the suction surface of the blade is the concave curved surface which is recessed to the counterrotation side. Accordingly, in the turbine wheel, a separation angle of the clearance flow with respect to the suction surface in the present embodiment is larger than a separation angle of the clearance flow with respect to the suction surface in Comparative Example. Accordingly, in the turbine wheel, most of the leakage fluid flowing to the suction surface side of the blade through the tip clearance in the portion on the leading edge side of the blade is not attached to the suction surface of the blade and flows to be separated from the suction surface. In this way, in the turbine wheel, most of the leakage fluid flows to be separated from the suction surface of the blade, and thus, it is possible to suppress attraction of the clearance flow. As a result, compared to Comparative Example, in the turbine wheel, it is possible to reduce the clearance flow and increase the turbine efficiency.', 'In the turbine wheel according to a second aspect of the present invention in order to achieve the above-described object, in the turbine wheel of the first aspect, the suction surface has a root portion which includes a boundary between the suction surface and the outer peripheral surface, the leading edge, and the trailing edge, and is in contact with the leading edge side of blade tip and the trailing edge side of blade tip, and the root portion forms a convex curved surface which protrudes to the rotation side.', 'In the turbine wheel according to a third aspect of the present invention in order to achieve the above-described object, in the turbine wheel of the second aspect, a boundary line between the leading edge side of blade tip and the root portion is positioned at a position which is less than half a blade height from the tip in a blade height direction.', 'In the turbine wheel according to a fourth aspect of the present invention in order to achieve the above-described object, in the turbine wheel of any one of the first to third aspects, the leading edge side of blade tip and the trailing edge side of blade tip are in contact with each other, and a boundary line between the leading edge side of blade tip and the trailing edge side of blade tip on a tip line formed at a boundary between the tip and the suction surface is positioned at a position at which a distance from the leading edge to the boundary line is equal or more than half the entire length of the tip line.', 'In the turbine wheel according to a fifth aspect of the present invention in order to achieve the above-described object, in the turbine wheel of any one of the first to fourth aspects, a curvature radius of the concave curved surface in the leading edge side of blade tip is equal to or more than a curvature radius of the convex curved surface in the trailing edge side of blade tip.', 'In the turbine wheel according to a sixth aspect of the present invention in order to achieve the above-described object, in the turbine wheel of any one of the first to fifth aspects, the pressure surface includes a leading edge side of blade tip including a boundary between the pressure surface and the tip and the leading edge and a trailing edge side of blade tip including a boundary between the pressure surface and the tip and the trailing edge, the leading edge side of blade tip of the pressure surface forms a convex curved surface which protrudes to the counterrotation side when viewed in the radial direction, and the trailing edge side of blade tip of the pressure surface forms a concave curved surface which is recessed to the rotation side when viewed in the radial direction.', 'According to a seventh aspect of the present invention in order to achieve the above-described object, there is provided a radial turbine including: the turbine wheel according to any one of the first to sixth aspects; a turbine rotary shaft which extends in the axial direction about the axis and to which the turbine wheel is fixed; and a turbine housing which covers the turbine wheel to be rotatable.', 'According to an eighth aspect of the present invention in order to achieve the above-described object, there is provided a turbocharger including: the radial turbine according to the seventh aspect; and a compressor, in which the compressor includes a compressor rotary shaft which is rotated about the axis, an impeller which is fixed to the compressor rotary shaft, and a compressor housing which covers the impeller, in which the turbine rotary shaft and the compressor rotary shaft are positioned on the same axis to be connected to each other and are integrally rotated with each other to form a turbocharger rotary shaft.",0

If there is no limitation on the communication fee, a terminal may repeatedly use a contents, and in this case, a net-communication fee to be paid by the contents provider may exceed the level previously set by the contents provider.

"However, in the above-described configuration of Patent Literature 1, since a packing is interposed between a connecting-side end surface of one element bed and a connecting-side end surface of the other element bed, the end surface of the one element bed and the end surface of the other element bed are not in contact with each other. Therefore, connecting rigidity between the one element bed and the other element bed is not high. Further, although Patent Literature 1 states that the element beds are connected to each other by the connecting mechanism in a state where the packing is interposed between the element beds and the element beds are drawn to each other to minimize the distance between them, the packing being interposed can cause positional deviation between the element beds.

"As described above, sidelink transmission of 3GPP Release 12 uses a subset of uplink resources in frequency and time domains. Thus, a UE cannot receive a sidelink signal transmitted from another UE in a subframe during sidelink transmission. This is because a signal transmitted from the UE is received by the UE itself as a high-power interference signal.', 'Accordingly, in a subframe in which a UE is transmitting scheduling assignment information (i.e., SCI format 0) on a PSCCH, it cannot receive scheduling assignment information (SCI format 0) transmitted from another UE. If a UE fails to receive scheduling assignment information in a certain sidelink control period (PSCCH period), it also fails in data reception (PSSCH reception) in the sidelink control period associated with this scheduling assignment information. It should be noted that the number of subframes included in the portion of radio resources for PSCCH (i.e., subframe pool for PSCCH) in which scheduling assignment information is transmitted is smaller than the number of subframes included in the portion of radio resources for data transmission (PSSCH transmission) (i.e., subframe pool for PSSCH).

"As described hereinabove, the present invention brings about the following effects.', 'In the first and fifth aspects, the compression mechanism has the circular hole, and at least a part of the circular hole is located within the area defined by extending the intake hole in a plan view. This circular hole is useable as an assembly-purpose positioning hole in the process of assembling the compressor. Now, suppose the situation where the compression mechanism is positioned by inserting the assembly-purpose positioning pin fixed to the support table into the circular hole (assembly-purpose positioning hole) in the process of assembling the compressor. When the inlet tube is pressed into the intake hole in this situation, a force in a direction of rotation about the positioning hole is hardly exerted to the compression mechanism. As a result, rotation of the compression mechanism about the assembly-purpose positioning pin is suppressed when the inlet tube is pressed in the intake hole in the process of assembling the compressor. This makes the air gap uniform throughout the entire circumference, to prevent an increase in noise from the compressor in operation.', 'In the second aspect, because the circular hole is formed by machining or sintering, it is less likely that there is variation in the inner diameter size of the hole. For this reason, when the circular hole is used as the assembly-purpose positioning hole in the process of assembling the compressor, the compression mechanism is properly positioned.', 'In the third aspect, because the intake hole and the circular hole are located in the single member, a difference in height is small between the intake hole and the circular hole (including the case where the intake hole and the circular hole are located at substantially the same height). Accordingly, when the inlet tube is pressed in the intake hole in the process of assembling the compressor, it is possible to restrain inclination of the compression mechanism relative to the height direction.', 'In the fourth aspect, the center of the circular hole is located within the area defined by extending the intake hole in a plan view. Therefore, in the situation where the circular hole is used as the assembly-purpose positioning hole in the process of assembling the compressor, the rotation of the compression mechanism about the assembly-purpose positioning pin is prevented when the inlet tube is pressed in the intake hole at the time of assembling the compressor. This makes the air gap uniform throughout the entire circumference, to effectively prevent an increase in noise from the compressor in operation.",1

"As described above, in the case of a charged particle beam inspection and measurement apparatus which picks up an image by scanning a primary charged particle on a specimen, and acquiring generated secondary charged particle beam, an expansion of the wafer due to heating by charged particle beam irradiation has not become a serious problem in the past. However, in recent years, a problem has surfaced that the wafer expands due to the heat generated in the wafer transport apparatus. Hereafter, details thereof will be described.', 'For a wafer inspection and measurement apparatus utilizing a charged particle beam, there is always a demand to increase the speed of wafer processing, that is, to reduce the time needed to perform predetermined processing per one sheet of semiconductor wafer. One of the largest factors that determine the throughput of wafer processing of various apparatuses includes a wafer transport speed. In recent wafer inspection and measurement apparatuses, as the demand for increasing the speed of wafer processing or increasing the number of measurement and inspection points grows, there arises the need for moving the specimen stage substantially faster than before. Since the specimen stage is stopped during image pick-up, moving the specimen stage at a high speed means that rapid controlled motion such as rapid acceleration and sudden stopping are repeated many times. While a stage transport apparatus includes driving means such as a linear motor, an ultrasonic motor, or a combination of a ball screw and a pulse motor; in any case, heat generation at the sliding portion is unavoidable. Moreover, as the moving speed of the specimen stage increases, the amount of heat generation will increase. Therefore, even when the stage is continuously moved at a constant speed, if the moving speed is increased, the amount of heat generated at the transport apparatus increases, and thereby the expansion of the wafer becomes a problem.', 'On the other hand, when performing temperature control of the wafer in a wafer inspection and measurement apparatus using a charged particle beam, there is a task to restrict the occurrence of foreign materials. While, in the invention disclosed by Patent Literature 1, a thermocouple is brought into contact with the back side of the wafer to detect the temperature of the wafer, such contact will cause the occurrence of foreign materials. Since the foreign material that has occurred flies up during the transport of the wafer, it may cause sticking of foreign material on the wafer surface and pollution thereof. Moreover, in some manufacturing processes such as light exposure, foreign materials on the back side of the wafer may cause a problem. This is because the change of the height of the wafer due to the presence or absence of the foreign material on the back side may cause a focus deviation. In the case of a wafer inspection and measurement apparatus, since it will not be allowed that the quality of processing object changes between before and after inspection and measurement, when the temperature control of the wafer is performed in a wafer inspection and measurement apparatus utilizing a charged particle beam, it is required to perform the temperature measurement of the wafer to restrict the occurrence of foreign materials or the measurement of variation amount in wafer size.",2

"If differences arise between the characteristics of air-fuel ratio sensors positioned before and after a catalyst due to manufacturing errors or deterioration or the like of the air-fuel ratio sensors, the output errors between the air-fuel ratio sensors will influence the respective control parameters thereof. Consequently, in catalyst failure detection that is performed based on the outputs of air-fuel ratio sensors positioned before and after a catalyst, a situation can occur in which an S/N ratio of a normality or abnormality determination becomes narrow.

"Now, the above-described near field wireless communication pairing methods are all methods for pairing one-to-one.

In the case of wireless LAN for example, a server is needed on the network thereof, and for example pairings cannot be completed by locally connecting the wireless communication terminals to one another.', 'The present invention has been made in light of this current state, and it is an object thereof to provide a connection method for near-field wireless communication wherein desired wireless communication devices which are capable of near-field wireless communication can be readily paired, and also wherein one-to-many pairings can be completed approximately simultaneously.",2

"Hereinafter, the fact that the uplink TDD subframe is estimated to be the downlink TDD subframe or the fact that the downlink TDD subframe is estimated to be the uplink TDD subframe is referred to as an “estimation error.” For example, the TDD frame information estimation unit may make this estimation error if the configuration of the TDD subframe of the wireless communication system is changed.', 'The TDD frame information estimation unit estimates the TDD non-transmission period on the basis of the uplink signal of the wireless communication system. If an estimation error occurs, the TDD frame information estimation unit erroneously estimates the TDD non-transmission period. The estimation error affects communication quality of the wireless communication system. For example, if a communication system other than the wireless communication system transmits an uplink signal during the TDD transmission period, the uplink signal of the wireless communication system may be delayed.', 'FIG. 17 is a time chart showing an example of traffic in a normal state. In the normal state, an estimated TDD non-transmission period and an actual TDD non-transmission period have the same timing if a propagation delay is ignored. That is, the uplink signal of the wireless communication system is transmitted in synchronization with a break of the configuration of the TDD subframe. The uplink signal of another communication system is transmitted in synchronization with a break of the configuration of the TDD subframe.', 'FIG. 18 is a time chart showing an example of traffic of an abnormal state in which an estimation error occurs. In the abnormal state, the estimated TDD non-transmission period is different from the actual TDD non-transmission period. Transmission of the uplink signal of the wireless communication system is delayed until a signal transmission section allocated on the basis of the estimation result. This delay is on the order of milliseconds, but there is a problem in that the delay cannot be tolerated in a mobile fronthaul.', 'In view of the above-described circumstances, an objective of the present invention is to provide a transmission system, a transmission method, and a transmission device capable of minimizing a delay occurring in a signal of a communication system even when an estimation error occurs in a configuration of the signal of the communication system in a transmission system, which accommodates a communication line of a communication system for performing communication according to TDD and a communication line of another communication system.",2

"In the technology disclosed in PTL 1, the larger the diameter of the irradiation spot of the excitation light, the less an influence of a drift in the excitation light or adrift in the nanopore as a measurement portion. However, the large diameter of the irradiation spot has several demerits. First, since portions other than a measurement portion are irradiated, signals of noise and a background increase. Second, since the irradiation spot is large, much heat is supplied to the conductive thin film, service life of the conductive thin film is shortened, and thus it is not possible to measure for a long time. However, when the irradiation spot is small, the heat is likely to diffuse outside. Third, in a case where a plurality of nanopores are irradiated, the larger the irradiation spot, the higher an output is required from an excitation light source, and thus equipment needs to increase in size and costs. In other words, the closer the irradiation spot is to the size of the nanopore that the biopolymers approach or is to a size with which the biopolymers are detected, the more preferable. For this reason, it is necessary to control the excitation light and the nanopore at a fixed position with high accuracy. As a main factor of the drift, a change in an ambient temperature around an installed device is considered. It is easy to assume that a drift of a few micrometers or a few nanometers, as a drift within a range of a normal living environment, which varies depending on a configuration of the device or a temperature change, is produced due to a linear expansion coefficient of a material of which the device is configured. Hence, it is desirable to have a function of avoiding the drift.', 'In the technology disclosed in PTL 2, detection and measurement of a pattern in a determined region, in which a specific pattern is provided, are repeated, and thereby it is possible to perform the remeasurement at an optimal position by using a correction function even when the drift occurs; however, since the measurement is not performed during the detection of the pattern in the determined region, a data loss of sample measurement occurs during the detection of the pattern. For example, when pass of DNA occurs during the detection of the pattern causes the loss of data to an equivalent amount in a nanopore Raman DNA sequence. As a result, since an amount of data of the DNA sequence acquired per unit time decreases, it is necessary to prolong measurement time to an equivalent amount thereof. Further, in a case where the drift occurs during the pass of the DNA and detection of the pattern is performed for correction, it is possible to partially analyze data of the DNA which is acquired during the pass, and loss of characteristics of the nanopore Raman DNA sequence in which it is possible to analyze a single molecule is likely to occur. For example, when a correction operation is performed at a position at which 5,000 bases are measured during measurement of a DNA sequence having 10,000 bases, the remaining 5,000 bases pass through the nanopore during the correction, and thus it is not possible to perform the measurement. Even when a drift is detected before the correction and movement of DNA is stopped, there is likely to be a region in which it is not possible to perform measurement because the movement due to inertial motion is not rapidly stopped.', 'In recent years, studies on genome sequencing, an RNA analysis, an epigenome analysis or the like at a one-cell level are actively performed, and differences depending on cells or various types of changes occurring in a time change in the same cell are analyzed. Genome sequences in individuals are known to be different for each cell in some cases. In particular, when a cancer tissue is harvested and the genome sequence is analyzed, data of a mixture of normal cells and cancer cells is usually acquired. Since the cancer cells change with time, a plurality of types of mixed sequence data are acquired in some cases. When it is possible to determine the genome sequence of the cancer tissue for each cell, more accurate knowledge on causes and propagation of cancer is considered to be acquired, and thus studies thereon are performed day by day. For the purposes, a Raman nanopore DNA sequencer is useful in analysis of DNA of a single molecule in one cell.', 'In addition, in the technology disclosed in PTL 3, since a device is provided with various types of means such as displacement detecting means, vibration means, and heating and cooling means, which are not needed to achieve original objects of measurement, the device has a complicated configuration, and thus the device needs advance control and increases in costs. In order to reduce the influence of heating as a main factor of the drift, options of using invar or diamond which has a small linear expansion coefficient are provided for the entire device; however, it is not practical regarding cost or machinability. In addition, a method in which large heat capacity makes it difficult to receive influences of an ambient temperature is also provided as an option; however, a lack of convenience is caused in that an increase in weight due to the large heat capacity requires a broad site in which the device is installed, or it is necessary to prepare a strong desk or the like on which the device is installed.', 'Objects of the invention in the present application are to solve problems described above and to provide a fixed position controller in which it is possible to simultaneously observe the sample and perform fixed position control on a sample, and a fixed position control method.",2
"According to the conventional techniques, a plurality of division points or a facial contour are arranged in accordance with a detected facial image. Thus, in a case where a face of a facial image inclines, it is necessary to rotate the plurality of divided points or the facial contour in accordance with the inclination of the face. Therefore, it is necessary to find a boundary of an area surrounded by the plurality of division points or the facial contour and to determine, for each pixel of the image, in which area the each pixel is included. This results in an increase in processing load. Especially, a problem of a longer processing time occurs when the face transforming function is carried out in small-sized devices such as a digital camera and a camera mobile phone.', 'The present invention has been made in view of the problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide an image transforming device and the like which can reduce a processing load.",2

"In a self-tapping screw in which a normal thread and a female screw molding thread having a larger diameter than that of the normal thread are molded in a leg portion, out of pitches of the normal thread positioned in a head portion side from the female screw molding thread, any one pitch is set to be larger than other pitches.', 'According to such a self-tapping screw, a distance between a pressure flank surface of the normal thread and a pressure flank surface of the female thread is closer than a distance between a clearance flank surface of the normal thread and a clearance flank surface of the female thread. However, in fastening and rotating, since the normal thread is screwed while being pressed in a fastening direction, contact resistance is insignificant between the pressure flank surface of the normal thread and the pressure flank surface of the female thread. On the other hand, in fastening and fixing, action of axial force causes the pressure flank surface of the normal thread to approach and come into contact with the pressure flank surface of the female thread, thereby increasing fastening force. Therefore, the self-tapping screw of the present invention not only reduces driving torques but also improves the fastening force. Accordingly, it is possible to sufficiently achieve the fastening force without causing cracks even when the self-tapping screw is used in a workpiece made of a soft material such as an aluminum alloy or a resin.', 'In addition, it is preferable that a pressure flank angle of the normal thread be set to be smaller than a pressure flank angle of the female screw molding thread.', 'According to the self-tapping screw, in fastening and fixing, a crest of the normal thread is wedged into the pressure flank surface of the female thread. Therefore, it is possible to expect more increased fastening force.",0

"As a result of diligent research to solve the problems described above, the present inventors found that the problems can be solved by employing a method of producing PAS, including a first-stage polymerization step of a reaction mixture that is in a uniformly dissolved state and a second-stage polymerization step in a phase-separated state, and at this time, a particular temperature condition is selected in the first-stage polymerization step and then the polymerization reaction is continued as a second-stage polymerization step by adding a particular amount of alkali metal hydroxide at a time or in portions in the presence of a phase separation agent in the reaction system, and thus completed the present invention.', 'According to the present invention, a method of producing PAS by subjecting a sulfur source and a dihalo aromatic compound to polymerization in an organic amide solvent, the method including:', '(1) a preparation step of preparing a preparation mixture containing an organic amide solvent, a sulfur source, an alkali metal hydroxide, water, and a dihalo aromatic compound, and having a pH of 12.5 or higher;', '(2) a first-stage polymerization step of heating the preparation mixture to a temperature of 170° C. or higher to initiate a polymerization reaction and continuing the polymerization reaction at temperatures of 240 to 280° C., thereby forming a prepolymer having a dihalo aromatic compound conversion rate of 50% or greater; and",0
"The interference observation apparatus disclosed in Non Patent Document 1 outputs the first split light or the second split light from the original optical path to the side once, sequentially reflects the light on two mirrors of which the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular to each other, and then returns the light to the original optical path.

"In order to solve the above problems, an insulation resistance measurement device according to the present invention is an insulation resistance measurement device for measuring an insulation resistance to ground of a DC circuit, comprising: first and second connection terminals for connections to two measurement points of the DC circuit; a switching unit connected between the first and second connection terminals and the ground potential and configured to switch connections between the first and second connection terminals and the ground potential; at least one resistive element connected through the switching unit between the first and second connection terminals and the ground potential; and a voltage detection unit which detects voltage drops in the resistive element.', 'According to the insulation resistance measurement device of this configuration, the first and second connection terminals are connected respectively to the two measurement points of the DC circuit and the switching unit is exclusively switched to the first connection terminal and to the second connection terminal, whereby the voltage detection unit can separately detect the voltage drop in the resistive element connected between one connection point and the ground potential and the voltage drop in the resistive element connected between the other connection point and the ground potential. As a consequence, the insulation resistance to ground of the DC circuit can be derived based on values of the two voltage drops. Therefore, the insulation resistance measurement device is able to perform high-sensitivity detection of the insulation failure of the DC circuit, irrespective of insulation failure points, by means of the simple detection circuit and also ensure safety during the detection because there is no need for application of unnecessary voltage.', 'As another aspect, an insulation resistance measurement method according to the present invention is an insulation resistance measurement method for measuring an insulation resistance to ground of a DC circuit, comprising: a step of connecting a resistive element between a first measurement point of the DC circuit and the ground potential and detecting a first voltage drop occurring in the resistive element; a step of connecting a resistive element identical to or different from the aforementioned resistive element, between a second measurement point of the DC circuit and the ground potential and detecting a second voltage drop occurring in the resistive element; and a step of calculating the insulation resistance to ground, based on values of the first and second voltage drops.', 'According to the insulation resistance measurement method as described above, the first connection terminal is connected to the first measurement point of the DC circuit, the voltage drop is detected in the resistive element connected between the first connection point and the ground potential, the second connection terminal is then connected to the second measurement point of the DC circuit, and the voltage drop is detected in the resistive element connected between the second connection point and the ground potential. Then the insulation resistance to ground of the DC circuit is derived based on the values of the two voltage drops. This enables high-sensitivity detection of the insulation failure of the DC circuit, irrespective of insulation failure points, by the simple detection circuit and also ensures safety during the detection because there is no need for application of unnecessary voltage.",0

"Although, the cutting and machining of CFRP is difficult, delamination (interlayer peeling), surface peeling, and burrs due to uncut fibers, or damage to resin or fiber are likely to occur. Further, since the fibers are prone to break in the fiber axis radial direction and become fines, further improvement in machining efficiency is a major issue.', 'That is, since the CFRP is made by hardening fine carbon fibers with epoxy resin and the like, the glass transition temperature (Tg) is low, such as about 250° C. to 350° C. Therefore, if the sharpness of a tool is lowered, there will be an increase in the machining torque (cutting resistance) and cutting temperature. Because of the increase of the cutting temperature, the resin easily becomes soft or viscous (hereafter, called as “softening”).', 'Therefore, resin peeling becomes easier to occur, due to the softening of the resin, and the sharpness of a tip blade is further reduced. As a result, a part of the carbon fiber remains without being cut, and the uncut-long fibers increase. Further, fracture of a member to be machined caused by the uncut-long fibers being caught in a rotating tool and pulled, or fluffing due to the remaining uncut-long fibers occur, and thus the machining quality is significantly reduced.', 'A drill for forming a hole or a reamer for finishing the hole which is machined by the drill have a margin portion which does not have a relief surface in the outer periphery of a blade portion. Therefore, since a cutting operation is performed in a condition with the whole margin portion being in contact with a member to be machined, the heat generated by the friction becomes large, and thus the abrasion of the blade tip extends to the entire blade. Therefore, if the blade tip is worn out, the machining torque increases and a part of the torque becomes a force in the axial direction (thrust direction). This force in the thrust direction becomes a major cause, in the cutting and machining of CFRP and the like, for the occurrence of delamination and the like particularly at an inlet portion and an outlet portion of the hole. However, as there is no delamination and the like in the case of machining a conventional metal material, the force acting in the thrust direction was not treated as a problem in the drilling industry.', 'Further, there are some cases where a cutting oil cannot be used for cooling or lubricating the blade tip portion (machining point) or for discharging chips in the cutting and machining of CFRP and the like (for example, in aircraft manufacturing or drilling with a manual driver).', 'In the above-mentioned cases, the cutting and machining process becomes a dry machining. Therefore, there will be degradation of resin because of a rapid temperature rise due to the cutting without supply of the cooling oil. In addition, since the chips generated by drilling contain a large amount of very hard fine powder, the abrasion of the blade tip of a tool goes rapidly and the sharpness of the blade tip will decreased. Accordingly, the occurrence of delamination and the like is promoted. Further, the scattered fine powder has adverse effects on the human body (for example, “pneumoconiosis”) or adverse effects on the surrounding machinery (for example, “abrasion of a sliding surface”).', 'In the drilling apparatus described in Patent Document 1, the outermost peripheral blade portion (4c) is laid vertically toward the direction of fibers, such that the cutting function of the fibers can be increased in the outer peripheral side. Further, the drill has a configuration in which the generation of new burrs in machining the outer periphery side of a region to be cut is suppressed, and a wiper effect on the surface of a hole is also obtained. Thus, the surface roughness of the hole, formed by the drilling apparatus of Patent Document 1, is better compared to conventional drills. Also, the discharge of chips is enhanced by providing a groove (8) that divides the margin (7).', 'However, the drill disclosed in Patent Document 1 has following drawbacks:', '(1) Chips are jetted in the state of extremely-fine fine powder and are discharged in large numbers with scattering in the air (refer to FIG. 5 of the present application (conventional drill)). This is because the chips between the margin (7) and the cutting wall are pulverized as in a millstone, and very fine powder is generated. The scattering phenomenon of the fine powder similarly occurs even in the case of a drill having a curved double-blade and a groove provided as a straight groove (as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Publication 2010-214478). Since the thrust force at the time of drilling entirely acts on the blade tip, it will be F (machine side thrust force)=f (cutting blade thrust force).', '(2) The embodiment 4 of Patent Document 1, as shown in FIG. 4, has a configuration in which a plurality of grooves (8) having a small shallow width and a shape of a small straight groove (nick) are provided only at the margin (7) provided at the tip of a spiral land. To such grooves (8) having a small straight groove shape, softened resin and hardened fine powder will gradually adhere, and sooner or later, it will lead to a state of clogging. As a result, the drill of Patent Document 1 has a defect in that delamination (this is called as “tear” in the Patent Document 1) will occur on the wall of less than or equal to 1 mm, and thus the finishing of the hole cannot be done with high accuracy.', '(3) In drilling of soft materials, such as aluminum die-cast having non-uniformity in their internal composition, the cutting traveling direction of the tip portion of the drill is bent due to the non-uniformity of the material, and the straight traveling ability of the drill is thus decreased. Therefore, forming a cutting hole with high accuracy was difficult.', 'The present invention has been made in view of the aforementioned problems of the prior art technologies. An object of the present invention is to provide a drilling apparatus which can carryout high-quality and efficient boring machining (drilling machining) for a material made of, for example, CFRP or the like which are hard to be cut or machined, and a method for forming the hole. In this description, the term “hole” is used so as to include both a through-hole and an unpenetrated blind hole.",2

For this reason, no matter how an SiC wafer arranged on the holder is arranged, the SiC wafer is improved in in-plane uniformity of the doping density. Further, the variation in doping density among SiC wafers in the case of placing a plurality of SiC wafers on the holder can be reduced.",1
"In order to solve the problem described above, the present invention adopts a configuration in which, in order to ascertain a cyclic load which occurs in a motion guidance device and which is related to a lifespan thereof, a sensor for detecting a displacement of a moving member in a prescribed number of displacement directions in the device is arranged in plurality. Using detected values of the sensors, an actual lifespan of the motion guidance device can be accurately calculated and, at the same time, sharing information related to the lifespan between a user of the motion guidance device and a manufacturer of the motion guidance device enables efficiency of management related to the motion guidance device by both parties to be improved.', 'Specifically, the present invention is a management system which manages user equipment installed in a prescribed space managed by a user, the user equipment including a plurality of motion guidance devices each including: a track member which extends along a longitudinal direction; a moving member which is arranged so as to oppose the track member via a rolling element rollably arranged in a rolling groove and which is relatively movable along the longitudinal direction of the track member; and a plurality of displacement sensors which detect displacements of the moving member in a prescribed number of displacement directions in the moving member. In addition, the management system includes: a reception unit which receives lifespan-related information calculated on the basis of detected values of the plurality of displacement sensors included in each of the plurality of motion guidance devices, the lifespan-related information being related to a lifespan exhaustion ratio of the motion guidance device; a calculation unit which calculates a lifespan exhaustion ratio of each motion guidance device on the basis of the lifespan-related information having been received by the reception unit and corresponding to each of the plurality of motion guidance devices; a determination unit which determines, on the basis of the lifespan exhaustion ratio of each of the plurality of motion guidance devices calculated by the calculation unit, replacement object devices constituting a part of or all of the plurality of motion guidance devices, the replacement object devices being motion guidance devices to be replaced within a prescribed period from a reception timing of the lifespan-related information by the reception unit; and a manufacturing management unit which notifies the user of a replacement timing at which all of the replacement object devices determined by the determination unit in the user equipment are to be replaced.', 'The management system according to the present invention is a system which manages user equipment including a plurality of motion guidance devices, each motion guidance device including a track member and a moving member and being further provided with a plurality of displacement sensors which detect displacements of the moving member in a prescribed number of displacement directions in the moving member. The plurality of displacement sensors detect, when the moving member performs a relative movement with respect to the track member, how much the moving member has been displaced with respect to the track member in a prescribed number of displacement directions defined so as to enable a cyclic load that acts on the moving member to be calculated. Therefore, the displacement directions detectable by the displacement sensors do not include a movement direction of the moving member itself with respect to the track member.', 'Detected values output from the plurality of displacement sensors mounted to a motion guidance device as described above are to be used in a calculation process of lifespan-related information. The lifespan-related information is information related to a lifespan exhaustion ratio of the motion guidance device. In this case, the lifespan exhaustion ratio refers to a rate representing how much of a maximum usable period of the motion guidance device has already been used and, for example, a lifespan exhaustion ratio of 100% signifies a state where the maximum usable period has been used up and the motion guidance device can no longer be used. The lifespan-related information may be information including a value of the lifespan exhaustion ratio itself, information which is generated by processing detected values of the displacement sensors and which is necessary for calculating the lifespan exhaustion ratio, or information including detected values of the displacement sensors themselves which enable the lifespan exhaustion ratio to be calculated. In addition, the management system according to the present invention receives, with the reception unit, the lifespan-related information from the plurality of motion guidance devices included in the user equipment.', 'Furthermore, in the management system according to the present invention, the calculation unit calculates the lifespan exhaustion ratio of each motion guidance device on the basis of the received lifespan-related information. As described above, since the lifespan-related information is based on detected values of the displacement sensors mounted to the motion guidance devices, the lifespan-related information can be described as information reflecting an actual use state of the motion guidance devices. Therefore, the lifespan exhaustion information calculated on the basis of the lifespan-related information strongly reflects an actual lifespan of the motion guidance devices. In addition, the determination unit determines replacement object devices on the basis of the calculated lifespan exhaustion ratios. Since the replacement object devices are motion guidance devices to be replaced before reaching a state where the motion guidance devices are unusable and within a prescribed period in which the motion guidance devices can be replaced without leaving a needlessly long usable period and the replacement object devices are determined using lifespan exhaustion ratios that strongly reflects the actual lifespans, waste in management of the motion guidance devices is less likely to be created. It should be noted that the number of motion guidance devices to become replacement object devices may fluctuate in accordance with the prescribed period.', 'In addition, in the management system according to the present invention, due to the manufacturing management unit notifying the user of replacement timings of all motion guidance devices having become replacement objects, the user is able to share timings at which all of the replacement object devices among the user\'s user equipment are to be replaced, which makes it easier for the user to formulate a use plan of the user equipment and realizes efficient management of the motion guidance devices. On the other hand, from the perspective of the management system, since the replacement object devices are determined by the determination unit in consideration of lifespan exhaustion ratios based on actual operating states, a manufacturing plan of the replacement object devices can be formulated more readily and more accurately. Therefore, the management system may be described as providing a management process of motion guidance devices to both the user and the manufacturer of the motion guidance devices. As described above, since the determined replacement object devices are determined so that waste in management is less likely to occur for both the user and the manufacturer, for example, the user can minimize a suspension period of the user equipment for replacing the motion guidance devices and, for example, the manufacturer can provide the user with new motion guidance devices for replacement in a timely manner, which in turn enables the manufacturer to reduce a risk of carrying surplus inventory.",0

"In the IC card reader described in Patent Literature 1, in a case that a card 2 is inserted into the insertion port in a correct posture, the card 2 is normally inserted from the one end 2e (in other words, in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 14(A)) in a state that the front face 2a is directed upward. As described above, in the IC card reader described in Patent Literature 1, the magnetic body sensor is disposed at a position where an external connection terminal 2c of an IC card inserted into the insertion port in a correct posture is passed. Therefore, in the IC card reader described in Patent Literature 1, for example, when a card 2 is inserted from the one end 2e side in a state that the rear face 2b is directed upward (in other words, in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 14(B), the external connection terminal 2c of the card 2 is passed at a position displaced from a position where the magnetic body sensor is disposed. Therefore, in the IC card reader, even when a card 2 is inserted in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 14(B), it can be detected that a posture of the inserted card 2 is not correct based on a detected result by the magnetic body sensor.', 'On the other hand, in the IC card reader described in Patent Literature 1, when a card 2 is inserted from the other end 2g side in a state that the rear face 2b is directed upward (in other words, in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 14(C)), the external connection terminal 2c of the card 2 may be passed through the position where the magnetic body sensor is disposed. However, the IC card reader described in Patent Literature 1 includes a shutter and the distance “L4” largely differs from the distance “L3” and thus, even when a card 2 is inserted in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 14(C), the other end 2g is abutted with the shutter before the external connection terminal 2c of the card 2 is passed through the position where the magnetic body sensor is disposed. Therefore, in the IC card reader, even when a card 2 is inserted in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 14(C), it can be detected that a posture of an inserted card 2 is not correct based on a detected result of the magnetic body sensor. However, in the IC card reader, if the shutter is not provided, it is difficult to detect that a posture of the inserted card 2 is not correct when a card 2 is inserted in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 14(C).', 'Further, when the metal sensor provided in the card reader described in Patent Literature 2 is provided in the card reader described in Patent Literature 3, also in the card reader described in Patent Literature 3, it can be detected whether a card formed with an external connection terminal has been inserted into the insertion port or not (in other words, whether an IC card has been inserted into the insertion port or not) based on a detected result of the metal sensor. Specifically, in the card reader described in Patent Literature 3, when a metal sensor is disposed at a position where an external connection terminal 2c of a card inserted into the insertion port in a correct posture (in other words, a card inserted into the insertion port in a direction where appropriate processing for a card can be performed in an inside of the card reader) is passed, even in the card reader described in Patent Literature 3, it can be detected whether a card formed with an external connection terminal 2c has been inserted into the insertion port or not based on a detected result of the metal sensor.', 'On the other hand, like a card reader described in Patent Literature 3, in a card reader in which a card formed in a substantially rectangular shape is taken in its short widthwise direction and is processed, when a card is to be inserted into the insertion port in a correct posture, a card 2 is, for example, as shown in FIG. 15(A), inserted from the one end face 2d side in a state that its front face 2a is directed upward (in other words, in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 15(A)). Further, in order to detect whether a card formed with an external connection terminal 2c has been inserted into the insertion port or not, in the card reader described in Patent Literature 3, a metal sensor is disposed at a position where an external connection terminal 2c of a card inserted into the insertion port in a correct posture is passed. Therefore, in the card reader, even when a card 2 is inserted from the other end face 2f side in a state that its rear face 2b is directed upward (in other words, in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 15(B)), the external connection terminal of the card 2 is passed through the position where the metal sensor is disposed.', 'Further, as described with reference to FIG. 14(A), the distance “L1” does not differ from the distance “L2” largely. Therefore, in the card reader described in Patent Literature 3, even in a case that a shutter is provided, an external connection terminal 2c of a card 2 may be detected by a metal sensor when the other end face 2f of the card 2 inserted in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 15(B) is abutted with the shutter. Accordingly, in a case that a metal sensor is provided in the card reader described in Patent Literature 3, sensibility of the metal sensor is required to be lowered so that, when a card 2 has been inserted from the other end face 2f side in a state that its rear face 2b is directed upward, the metal sensor does not detect the external connection terminal 2c of the card 2 and detects only a card 2 inserted in a correct direction.', 'An arrangement range of an external connection terminal 2c formed in an IC card 2 is specified in the international standard “ISO/IEC7816-2”. Specifically, in the international standard “ISO/IEC7816-2”, arrangement ranges of a first connection terminal 2p, a second connection terminal 2q, a third connection terminal 2r, a fourth connection terminal 2s, a fifth connection terminal 2t, a sixth connection terminal 2u, a seventh connection terminal 2v and an eighth connection terminal 2w which are formed as the external connection terminal 2c on the front face 2a of a card 2 are specified as shown in FIG. 16(B).

The unit of the dimension shown in FIG. 16(B) is “mm” (millimeter) and, when the first through the eighth connection terminals 2p through 2w are formed at the dimension values in the drawing, the sizes of the first through the eighth connection terminals 2p through 2w become the smallest. A card 2 may be used which is formed with no fourth connection terminal 2s and no eighth connection terminal 2w. ', 'In a case that a card formed in a substantially rectangular shape is taken in its longitudinal direction and processed like the card reader described in Patent Literature 2, even when the sizes of the first through the eighth connection terminals 2p through 2w are the smallest, respective distances between the first through the fourth connection terminals 2p through 2s are narrow in a short widthwise direction of the card 2 and, similarly, respective distances between the fifth through the eighth connection terminals 2t through 2w are also narrow and thus, even when attaching accuracy of a metal sensor in a short widthwise direction of a card 2 is relatively low, the first through the eighth connection terminals 2p through 2w can be detected by the metal sensor. Therefore, in the card reader described in Patent Literature 2, even when attaching accuracy of the metal sensor is relatively low, it can be detected whether a card formed with an external connection terminal has been inserted into an insertion port or not based on a detected result of the metal sensor.', 'On the other hand, in a case that a card formed in a substantially rectangular shape is taken in its short widthwise direction and processed like the card reader described in Patent Literature 3, when the sizes of the first through the eighth connection terminals 2p through 2w are the smallest, distances in a longitudinal direction of the card 2 between the first through the fourth connection terminals 2p through 2s and the fifth through the eighth connection terminals 2t through 2w are wide and thus, when attaching accuracy of the metal sensor in the longitudinal direction of the card 2 is low, it may be difficult that the first through the eighth connection terminals 2p through 2w are detected by the metal sensor. For example, when attaching accuracy of the metal sensor is low and an axial center of a core of the metal sensor is disposed between the first through the fourth connection terminals 2p through 2s and the fifth through the eighth connection terminals 2t through 2w in a longitudinal direction of the card 2, it may be difficult that the first through the eighth connection terminals 2p through 2w are detected by the metal sensor. As a result, there is a possibility that it is unable to detect whether a card formed with an external connection terminal has been inserted into an insertion port or not based on a detected result of the metal sensor.', 'Further, as described above, in a card reader in which a card formed in a substantially rectangular shape is taken in its short widthwise direction and processed, sensibility of the metal sensor is required to be lowered so that, when a card 2 has been inserted from the other end face 2f side in a state that its rear face 2b is directed upward, the metal sensor does not detect the first through the eighth connection terminals 2p through 2w of the card 2, and thereby it can be detected whether the card 2 has been inserted in a correct direction or not. Therefore, in a case that the sizes of the first through the eighth connection terminals 2p through 2w are the smallest, when attaching accuracy of the metal sensor in a longitudinal direction of the card 2 is low, a possibility incapable of detecting whether a card formed with an external connection terminal has been inserted into the insertion port or not based on a detected result of the metal sensor may be further increased.', 'Further, the distance “L1” does not differ from the distance “L2” largely as described above and thus, in the card reader described in Patent Literature 3, even in a case that a shutter is provided, when the other end face 2f of a card 2 inserted in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 15(B) is butted with the shutter, the external connection terminal 2c of the card 2 may be detected by the metal sensor. Therefore, in the card reader, when a card 2 is inserted in a direction shown by the arrow in FIG. 15(B), there is a possibility that it is unable to determine whether the card 2 has been inserted in a correct posture or not based on a detected result of the metal sensor.', 'When a case that a card 2 is inserted in a state that its front face 2a is directed upward and a case that a card 2 is inserted in a state that its rear face 2b is directed upward are compared with each other, signal levels of output signals of the metal sensor when the external connection terminal 2c is detected by the metal sensor are different from each other. For example, a signal level of an output signal of the metal sensor when an external connection terminal 2c is detected by the metal sensor in a case that a card 2 is inserted in a state that its front face 2a is directed upward is higher than a signal level of an output signal of the metal sensor when an external connection terminal 2c is detected by the metal sensor in a case that a card 2 is inserted in a state that its rear face 2b is directed upward. Therefore, when a threshold value is appropriately set for an output signal of the metal sensor, even in a case that an external connection terminal 2c of a card 2 inserted in a state that its rear face 2b is directed upward is detected by the metal sensor, it can be determined whether the card 2 has been inserted in a correct posture or not based on a detected result of the metal sensor.', 'However, according to considerations and examinations of the present inventors, the present inventors have found that there are some cards (hereinafter, referred to as a “low reactive card”) on the market whose signal level of an output signal of the metal sensor when an external connection terminal 2c is detected by the metal sensor is lower than that of a card commonly available on the market even in a case that the card 2 is inserted in a state that its front face 2a is directed upward. Further, the present inventors have examined and found that, since low reactive cards have been available on the market, it is difficult to appropriately set a threshold value for an output signal of the metal sensor and thus, there is a possibility that it is unable to determine whether a card 2 has been inserted in a correct posture or not based on a detected result of the metal sensor.', 'In view of the problem described above, at least an embodiment of the present invention provides a card reader in which an IC card in a substantially rectangular shape in conformity with the international standard or JIS standard is taken in its longitudinal direction and is processed, the card reader being capable of easily determining whether a posture of an inserted IC card is correct or not even when a shutter member for opening and closing a card passage where the IC card is passed is not provided. Further, at least an embodiment of the present invention provides a card reader in which an IC card in a substantially rectangular shape in conformity with the international standard or JIS standard is taken in its short widthwise direction and is processed, the card reader being capable of easily determining whether a posture of an inserted IC card is correct or not.', 'Further, in view of the problem described above, at least an embodiment of the present invention provides a card reader in which an IC card in a substantially rectangular shape in conformity with the international standard is taken in its short widthwise direction and is processed, the card reader being capable of appropriately detecting whether a card formed with an external connection terminal has been inserted into an insertion port or not based on a detected result of a metal detection mechanism in a case that the size of the external connection terminal is the smallest and, even when the sensibility of the metal detection mechanism is lowered.', 'In addition, in view of the problem described above, at least an embodiment of the present invention provides a card reader in which an IC card in a substantially rectangular shape in conformity with the international standard is taken in its short widthwise direction and is processed, the card reader being capable of appropriately determining whether a card has been inserted into an insertion port in a correct posture or not. Further, at least an embodiment of the present invention provides a control method for a card reader in which an IC card in a substantially rectangular shape in conformity with the international standard is taken in its short widthwise direction and is processed, the control method being capable of appropriately determining whether a card has been inserted into an insertion port in a correct posture or not.",2

"Incidentally, an increasing tendency to downsize electronic devices requires connectors mounted in the electronic devices to have reduced heights and areas. For example, when a connector having a height reduced as small as 1 mm from a substrate employs the actuator mechanism disclosed in the PTL 1 or the PTL 2 for retaining and unlocking a connection object, the actuator is necessitated to reduce its thickness and length. Consequently, rotation of the actuator becomes very difficult, thus deteriorating workability.', 'The connector described in the PTL 3 includes the unlock-pushing portion for releasing the connection object.

"Recently, switching performance of the boost converter has dramatically improved, and intermittent boosting, which cannot be conventionally realized, is also possible. The intermittent boosting namely means that a boosting operation and a boosting stop operation are actively repeated. If the intermittent boosting is executed, a boost loss of the boost converter becomes zero in a boosting stop period. Thus, the loss of the entire system including a power supply, the boost converter, and a loading apparatus (hereinafter it is referred to as a “system loss” as occasion demands) can be significantly reduced.', 'On the other hand, when the intermittent boosting is executed, the output voltage VH of the boost converter constantly varies according to a drive state of the loading apparatus in a predetermined range including a target value. Therefore, an effective value of the output voltage VH in an execution period of the intermittent boosting deviates from an original target value.', 'Here, the target value of the output voltage VH in the boost control is determined in such a manner that at least the loading apparatus can output required torque. However, when the aforementioned effective value is less than the target value, there is a possibility that the effective value is less than a required value corresponding to the required torque and that the loading apparatus cannot output the required torque. There is conventionally no effective solution to such a technical problem peculiar to the intermittent boosting.', 'The Patent Literature 1 apparently discloses a technical concept similar to the intermittent boosting; however, the technical concept disclosed in the Patent Literature 1 and the aforementioned intermittent boosting are, in fact, basically totally different. In other words, in the apparatus disclosed in the Patent Literature 1, a condition for deactivating the boost converter is that the output voltage VH (referred to as “secondary voltage V2” in the Patent Literature) of the boost converter does not decrease during the deactivation of the boost converter. In other words, this apparatus cannot deactivate the boost converter under a condition that the output voltage VH varies or cannot help varying. Except for an ideal no-load condition, for example, as described in a paragraph 0005 in the Patent Literature 1, in general, a low load variation occurs even under a condition which is defined as no load. In this apparatus, a change in the output voltage VH is suppressed by correcting command torque of the loading apparatus so as to suppress the load variation.', 'However, torque required for the loading apparatus is not related to circumstances on the boost converter side associated with the loss reduction. If actual output torque of the loading apparatus significantly deviates from a required value when the torque required for the loading apparatus is corrected, the loading apparatus hardly plays an original role. In particular, in a case where the loading apparatus is an electric motor for driving a vehicle, if torque supplied to a drive shaft connected to an axle shaft deviates from the required torque, power performance and drivability are likely significantly influenced. Therefore, in this apparatus, as consistently described in the Patent Literature, the control is effective only in a load region with the extremely low load (or in the predetermined range in which the total load power includes zero).', 'As described above, in the technical concept disclosed in the Patent Literature 1, it is not considered that the output voltage VH increases or decreases in the boosting stop period. Therefore, such a problem that the output torque of the loading apparatus is unexpectedly insufficient for the required value does not originally occur.', 'The present invention is invented in view of the aforementioned technical problem, and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a boost converter control apparatus configured to execute the intermittent boosting while satisfying drive requirements of the loading apparatus.",2
"The above conventional liquid crystal display device has a spacer with an alignment control electrode on its surface at an intersection of a scanning line and a signal line in a vertical alignment mode liquid crystal display element. The alignment control electrode provides a potential difference between the pixel electrode and a counter electrode, so as to enable formation of an electric field inclined from the normal line of the substrate, between the pixel electrode and the counter electrode. The liquid crystal display device can easily divide the alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules by forming an alignment control window in the pixel electrode or counter electrode, thereby having a multi-domain structure for achieving a wide viewing angle, high contrast, and high-speed response. The technique for improving the display characteristics by providing, for example, an alignment controlling object in a VA mode transmission liquid crystal display device includes a technique of providing a single domain structure in which the region in each pixel is dealt as a single region for alignment control, and a multi-domain structure in which the region in each pixel is divided into multiple regions for alignment control.', 'FIG. 1 of Patent Literature 1, for example, illustrates a liquid crystal display device using an alignment control window along one diagonal line in a pixel and pillar spacers at two ends of the other diagonal line, which provides alignment divided into two directions. Such a liquid crystal display device provides insufficient viewing angle compensation and relatively low alignment controlling forces at the corners without the spacers, compared to a liquid crystal display device providing four-direction alignment. Hence, residual images are produced or the response speed is inhibited. The liquid crystal display device also has a problem of transmittance loss resulting from provision of the alignment control window together with the spacers. FIG. 9 of Patent Literature 1, for example, illustrates a display device using alignment control windows along two diagonal lines, which provides four-division alignment leading to better display qualities; however, arrangement of spacers on the four sides of each pixel and an alignment control window leads to a large transmittance loss.', 'In terms of preventing the transmittance loss, a liquid crystal display panel have been widely considered to have a single domain structure with a smaller number of alignment controlling objects for alignment division, as a transmission pixel structure in the vertical alignment mode in a high definition region (≧250 PPI the number of pixels per inch). Liquid crystal display panels with a single domain structure have advantages that a high pixel aperture ratio is achieved with a smaller number of alignment controlling objects or reduced slit regions, and that the light transmittance and, in the case of semi-transmission liquid crystal display devices, the reflectance (hereinafter, these properties are referred to as “light transmittance and the like”) are increased. The single domain structure controlling alignment by a projection, a hole of the counter electrode, or the like arranged at the center of the domain, however, provides a lower liquid crystal alignment controlling force, which leads to a problem that desired display properties cannot be achieved depending on the product specification and the pressing stress. For example, at the borders between the upper and lower pixels at the domain ends in a single domain structure as illustrated in FIG. 8, no object is provided, and the alignment controlling force is not naturally set. To solve the problem, the shape of the pixel electrode can be improved, for example. However, the single domain structure has a large-sized domain compared to a multi-domain structure, and thus provides a relatively low alignment controlling force. Accordingly, a pixel pitch or cell thickness difference or pressing stress may cause misalignment at the borders between the upper and lower pixels. As a result, viewing angle compensation in pixels may not be sufficiently provided, and thus display roughness or color unevenness that can occur depending on the viewing angle is caused to decrease the display qualities. It is also possible to add projections or slits as alignment controlling objects at the borders between the upper and lower pixels at the domain ends, but such addition tends to deteriorate the above-mentioned advantages of a single domain structure that a high light transmittance can be achieved.', 'As mentioned above, liquid crystal display panels capable of achieving a sufficient transmittance and excellent display qualities have been strongly desired. Particularly, VA-mode, high definition liquid crystal panels for mobiles have been strongly desired which achieve a sufficient transmittance even with small pixel pitches, have excellent pressing stress resistance required for mobile devices, and achieve sufficient display qualities. Such VA mode, high definition liquid crystal panels for mobiles have been increasingly desired to include touch panels as a standard feature, and thus measures to take for the pressing stress are desired more than ever.', 'The present invention has been made in view of the above state of the art, and aims to provide a liquid crystal display panel that overcomes the weakness of the alignment in conventional single domain structures, improves display qualities (e.g. reduced display roughness, improved viewing angle with reduced color unevenness that can occur depending on the viewing angle) by the liquid crystal alignment controlling force irrespective of the external conditions or environments, increases the response speed, and contributes to reduction of steps (reduction of cost). Also, the liquid crystal display panel has excellent pressing stress resistance, excellent display properties in the case of use under low-temperature atmosphere, and excellent transmittance.",2

Accordingly, there is little need to use a motor as a generator, so that it is possible to simplify the structure of the braking device. Further, since there is little need to use a motor as described above, it is possible to suppress that the amount of generated power is limited by the capability of a motor. Furthermore, since friction energy itself converted from the kinetic energy of the rotating body is converted into electrical energy, it is possible to suppress that the friction energy is lost as heat energy. Accordingly, according to the invention, it is possible to improve power generation efficiency by a simple structure.', 'Further, as the structure that preferably obtains the above-mentioned operational effect, specifically, there may be provided a structure where the first power generating element portion includes an electromagnetic inductor and the second power generating element portion includes magnetic bodies provided integrally with the friction member and adapted so that the first power generating element portion is interposed between the magnetic bodies.', 'Furthermore, it is preferable that the magnetic bodies be adapted so that the generation and stopping of magnetic forces of the magnetic bodies can be controlled.

In this case, it is possible to control an electromotive force, which is generated by an electromagnetic induction phenomenon, by controlling the magnetic flux densities. As a result, it is possible to easily control power generation efficiency.', 'Furthermore, as the structure that preferably obtains the above-mentioned operational effect, specifically, there may be provided a structure where the first power generating element portion includes a first magnetic body and the second power generating element portion includes a second magnetic body and an electromagnetic inductor that is adapted so as to be interposed between the first and second magnetic bodies.', 'Moreover, it is preferable that the power generating device further include electrical connection portions.

Further, for the power module structure described in the prior art of Patent Document 1, since the control circuit board is fixed onto the bosses provided for the base plate, space on the base plate for arranging the switching elements is limited, and when large switching elements or many switching elements are to be arranged on the base plate, a problem has been encountered in that the size of the base plate, or of the entire DC/DC converter, would be increased.', 'When the size and the capacity of the switching elements become greater, an increased amount of current flows through the power-generating elements and the control element mounted on the control circuit board, and the generation of heat is increased.

"However, the viscous adhesive compositions and adhesive compositions disclosed in Patent Literatures 3 and 4 are insufficient in improvement effect on the above performances. In addition, even the compositions disclosed in Patent Literatures 5, 6 and 7 are still insufficient in performance balance between viscous adhesion characteristics and melting characteristics or coatability.', 'The present invention is thus made in view of the above-described problems in conventional arts, and an object of the present invention is to provide a block copolymer composition to serve as an adhesive composition being excellent in balance between viscous adhesion performance and melt viscosity and having excellent tack, retention strength, melting characteristics and coatability, and an adhesive composition comprising the block copolymer composition.', 'The present inventors diligently studied to solve the above problems, and have found that the above problems can be effectively solved by using two types of block copolymers each having a particular structure, composition and weight average molecular weight, and have completed the present invention.', 'Specifically, the present invention is as follows:', '1', 'A block copolymer composition comprising: 10% by mass or more and 90% by mass or less of a component (a), and 10% by mass or more and 90% by mass or less of a component (b), wherein', 'the component (a) is a block copolymer comprising a polymer block (A) mainly comprising a vinyl aromatic monomer unit and a polymer block (B) mainly comprising a conjugated diene monomer unit, wherein the block copolymer has a weight average molecular weight of 30,000 or higher and 150,000 or lower;', 'the component (b) is a block copolymer comprising a polymer block (A) mainly comprising a vinyl aromatic monomer unit and a polymer block (B) mainly comprising a conjugated diene monomer unit;', 'the component (b) comprises a component (b-2) at a ratio of weight average molecular weight to the weight average molecular weight of the component (a) of 2.5 or more and less than 3.4, and a component (b-3) at a ratio of weight average molecular weight to the weight average molecular weight of the component (a) of 3.4 or more and less than 4.5; and', 'a content of the vinyl aromatic monomer unit in the component (a) and the component (b) is 10 to 50% by mass based on a total amount of the component (a) and the component (b).', '2', 'The block copolymer composition according to item 1, having a viscosity in a 15% by mass toluene solution of 10 to 90 mPa·s.', '3', 'The block copolymer composition according to item 1, having a viscosity in a 15% by mass toluene solution of higher than 90 mPa·s and 600 mPa·s or less.', '4', 'The block copolymer composition according to any one of items 1 to 3, wherein the component (b) further comprises a component (b-1) at a ratio of weight average molecular weight to the weight average molecular weight of the component (a) of 1.5 or more and less than 2.5.', '5', 'The block copolymer composition according to item 4, wherein a ratio of an area for the component (b-1) in a GPC elution curve to a total area for the component (b) is 0.6 or less.', '6', 'The block copolymer composition according to item 4, wherein a ratio of an area for the component (b-1) in a GPC elution curve to a total area for the component (b) is 0.2 or less.', '7', 'The block copolymer composition according to any one of items 1 to 6, wherein",0

"As described above, the F-DOF is most promising among various EDOF techniques for digital still cameras. FIGS. 13 and 14 show structures required to achieve the F-DOF.', 'FIG. 13 is a block diagram showing a structure of an imaging apparatus 500 shifting a focus lens during the exposure time. The imaging apparatus 500 shown in FIG. 13 includes an imaging device 1, a lens 2, a focus lens 20, a shutter 3, a focus lens shift control unit 4, a shutter operation instructing unit 5, a release receiving unit 6, a focus lens initial position detecting unit 7, an exposure time determining unit 8, a focus lens position resetting unit 18, an exposure and focus shift synchronization managing unit 10, an image-restoration processing unit 11, a PSF storage unit 12, and an image data recording unit 13.', 'In the imaging apparatus 500 shown in FIG. 13, when the release receiving unit 6 receives an exposure start instruction from a user, the focus lens initial position detecting unit 7 detects the position of the focus lens 20 at that time (the initial position). Then the focus lens shift control unit 4 moves the focus lens 20 so that the focal point moves to an end point found at a predetermined range of focus; that is the nearest end shown in FIG. 15, for example. Here, in the predetermined range of focus and with respect to the imaging apparatus 500, the nearest end is at the nearest distance to the imaging apparatus 500, and the farthest end is at the farthest distance from the imaging apparatus 500.', 'Next, the exposure and focus shift synchronization managing unit 10 gives the shutter operation instructing unit 5 an instruction to operate the shutter 3. Simultaneously, the exposure and focus shift synchronization managing unit 10 gives focus lens shift control unit 4 an instruction to move the focus lens 20 from the nearest end to the farthest end. Then, as shown in FIG. 15, the focus lens shift control unit 4 moves the focus lens 20 so that the focal point arrives at the farthest end as soon as the exposure ends.', 'FIG. 14 is a block diagram showing a structure of an imaging apparatus 600 which shifts the imaging device 1 during the exposure time. The imaging apparatus 600 shown in FIG. 14 does not include the focus lens shift control unit 4 included in the imaging apparatus 500 and shifting the focus lens 20, the focus lens initial position detecting unit 7, the exposure and focus shift synchronization managing unit 10, and the focus lens position resetting unit 18. Instead, the imaging apparatus 600 includes an imaging device initial position detecting unit 14, an exposure and imaging device shift synchronization managing unit 16, an imaging device shifting control unit 17, and an imaging device position resetting unit 19.', 'In other words, the imaging apparatus 600 in FIG. 14 is different from the imaging apparatus 500 in FIG. 13 in that the imaging apparatus 600 moves the imaging device 1 to shift the focal point, while the imaging apparatus 500 moves the focus lens 20. Otherwise, the imaging apparatus 600 in FIG. 14 and the imaging apparatus 500 in FIG. 13 share structures and operations other than the above structures and operations. Thus the constituent features which correspond with each other have identical numeral references, and details thereof shall be omitted. Furthermore, the imaging apparatus 600 also includes the lens 2 including the focus lens 20 whose details shall be omitted.', 'Specifically, the F-DOF-based imaging apparatuses 500 and 600 need to reset the position of the focus lens 20 or the imaging device between the time when the shutter button is pressed and the time when the exposure actually starts. As seen above, the F-DOF suffers a significant disadvantage compared with other EDOFs in view of reducing the shutter time lag. The shutter time lag is an interval between the time when the user gives the exposure start instruction (in other words, when the user press the shutter) and the time when the exposure actually starts, as shown in FIG. 16.', 'In the case of an auto-focus camera, the shutter time lag is the sum of a time required to obtain the focus and a time (referred to as a release time lag) required to carry out other various processing. In the case of a camera having a mirror, such as a single-lens reflex camera, the release time lag includes a time required for the mirror to bounce, and a time required to close the blades of the diaphragm based on a determined exposure. It is noted that a normal shutter time lag is between 100 msec and several seconds whereas a release time lag is between 10 msec and 130 msc. Hence the auto-focusing operation takes much more time than the shutter-releasing operation.', 'Other techniques than the F-DOF (the WFC and the CA, for example) can obtain all-focus images without the auto-focus mechanism itself. Accordingly, the techniques can reduce a time for obtaining the focus. As a result, the shutter time lag can be significantly reduced. The F-DOF based imaging apparatuses 500 and 600 can obtain all-focus images, as well as carry out the auto-focus capturing and the manual-focus capturing. On the other hand, the imaging apparatuses 500 and 600 have to move the focus lens 20 or the imaging device 1 during the exposure from the far-end focal point to the near-end focal point or visa versa. Hence, before the exposure starts, the focus lens 20 or the imaging device 1 needs to be moved to the initial position; namely, the far-end focal point or the near-end focal point.', 'For example, assume the case where the imaging apparatus 500 or 600 comes into focus at a focal point in the regular auto-focus capturing or the manual-focus capturing. When the user desires to obtain an all-focus image immediately after obtaining the focal point in the regular auto-focus capturing or the manual-focus capturing, the focus lens needs to be reset as described above. This operation prevents the exposure from starting soon.', 'Typically, one of the EDOF\'s easily-assumed greatest assets for the user is to significantly reduce the shutter time lag; that is to bring an advantage in that the user can release the shutter at the moment he or she desires to capture the scene, as well as to obtain an all-focus image and free the user from obtaining an out-of-focus image. In the F-DOF, unfortunately, the processing is carried out in the above sequence in a conventional structure. Hence the F-DOF fails to obtain the former advantage.', 'It is noted that this problem is peculiar to digital cameras or digital cameras in conformity with the structures of the digital cameras, not for conventional microscopes or a small camera for cellular phones (no auto-focus mechanism).', 'The present invention is conceived in view of the above problem and has an object to provide an imaging apparatus and an imaging method having a small shutter time lag in the F-DOF.",2

"Incidentally, with an integration sphere, the number of instances of the diffuse reflection in the hollow sphere body generally increases as the diameter of the sphere body increases with respect to the surface area of the emission window. If the number of instances of diffuse reflection in the integration sphere increases, the uniformity of the luminance distribution on the surface of the emission window of the sample light emitted from the integration sphere improves.', 'Accordingly, in the method for calibrating a captured image of a display panel disclosed in Patent Document 1 described above, the sample light with a uniform luminance distribution on the surface of the emission window can be obtained by using a large integration sphere, and an accurate calibration coefficient can be created based on the sample light.', 'However, due to the fact that large-sized integration spheres are generally high in cost, there is concern that if a large integration sphere is introduced only to create the calibration coefficient for calibrating the captured image as in Patent Document 1 described above, investment in equipment for image processing systems that perform detection of display unevenness in display panels will increase.', 'The present invention was made in view of the foregoing circumstances, and aims to provide a light-emitting apparatus that can suppress the manufacturing cost to a low level and perform light emission with high uniformity using a simple configuration, a calibration coefficient calculation method performed using the light-emitting apparatus, and a method for calibrating a captured image of an inspection target object, in which the captured image of the inspection target object is calibrated based on a calculated calibration coefficient.",2

"Productivity, workability and physical property (particularly, liquid permeability and water absorption capacity under load) of a water absorbent resin are improved, and stabilized. And, a residual raw material (particularly, surface treating agent and sub-raw material thereof) in a water absorbent resin is reduced. The method of the present invention is suitably applied to a non-polymerized organic compound which is a solid at a normal temperature (particularly, surface crosslinking with alkylene carbonate compound and reduction in residual ethylene glycol), in a method for producing a water absorbent resin.', 'And, in improvement in a water absorbent resin, even when commercial continuous production (e.g. a few tons to a few thousand tons) is performed from the result at a laboratory level of a few hundred grams to a few kilograms, the result of a laboratory level is not reflected due to influence of a scale up factor, and reduction in physical property was accompanied in real production, in some cases. Namely, since a demonstration experiment by commercial continuous production is accompanied with restriction of a cost and a time in some cases, a method of predicting the result of commercial continuous production from the result of a laboratory has been desired.', 'That is, in a process for producing a water absorbent resin including many steps as in Patent Literatures 1 to 13 etc., the technique of improving or stabilizing physical property of a water absorbent resin is known as in Patent Literatures 14 to 22, but the technique is still not sufficient, and particularly, in continuous production at an industrial scale, it is necessary to reduce variation or spec out of physical property of a water absorbent resin, or simplify a production step. And, from greatness of influence on physical property and productivity, in a process for producing a water absorbent resin, influence of a surface crosslinking step is great, many surface crosslinking methods have been proposed as in Patent Literatures 23 to 44 etc., but those methods are still not sufficient, and it is necessary to provide a water absorbent resin which is of high physical property, and is stable. As a surface crosslinking agent, an alkylene carbonate compound, particularly, ethylene carbonate described in Patent Literatures 36 to 38 is generally used, but there was a problem of production of residual ethylene glycol as a byproduct described in Patent Literature 37.', 'Further, from a view point of reduction in a spec out product after surface crosslinking, particularly, when a non-polymerized organic compound which is a solid at a normal temperature and, among it, an alkylene carbonate compound is used as a surface crosslinking agent, operation of dissolving it greatly reduces productivity, and influence of flowability thereof due to an air temperature is great, and it is necessary to reduce ethylene glycol which is produced as a byproduct.

"The heretofore known journal bearing is of a structure in which the quantities of lubricant oil supplied from a plurality of pad stops other than the pad stop positioned on the rearmost side of the lower half carrier ring in a shaft rotation direction of the rotating shaft are all the same, and it is not necessary to adjust an oil quantity per pad stop. Also, a structure is such that no oil supply nozzle is provided on the upper half carrier ring side, thereby reducing a supply quantity of lubricant oil for the whole of the bearing.', 'An upstream side pad is disposed in a position on the upstream side in the shaft rotation direction, and a downstream side pad is disposed in a position on the downstream side, on the inner side of the lower half carrier ring configuring the journal bearing. Further, in the heretofore known configuration, a sufficient quantity of lubricant oil necessary for oil film formation is supplied to all the pads. However, even when an appropriate lubricant oil quantity is supplied between the rotating shaft and the upstream side pad, there is the problem that as oil drained from the upstream side pad flows to the downstream side pad, as carry-over oil, as the rotating shaft rotates, the quantity of lubricant oil supplied to the downstream side pad is in excess by an amount equivalent to the carry-over oil. Also, when the quantity of oil supplied to each pad is too small, no sufficient oil film is formed between the rotating shaft and the pads, causing a rise in oil film temperature or causing vibration, noise, or the like.', 'In this way, with the heretofore known journal bearing, as the same quantity of lubricant oil is supplied to both the upstream side and downstream side pads, the supply quantity of lubricant oil necessary for the whole of the bearing becomes too large for a stable operation, and it is difficult to supply an appropriate quantity of lubricant oil to each pad.', 'The invention, having been contrived in order to solve the heretofore described problems, has for its object to adjust a lubricant oil quantity supplied in accordance with the disposition of the pads and thus optimize a lubricant oil quantity supplied to the whole of the journal bearing, thereby reducing the lubricant oil quantity, thus reducing a bearing loss and downsizing oil supply equipment.",2

"The present invention improves a terminal structure for a secondary battery including an electrode group including a plurality of electrodes each having a tab and stacked via a separator. The terminal structure according to the present invention includes a terminal including a terminal portion and a terminal body portion, a stacked current collecting plate group, two or more fasteners, and at least one pressing member. The stacked current collecting plate group is formed by stacking a plurality of current collecting plates to which the tabs of the electrodes of the same polarity are welded. In the present invention, the pressing member is attached to the terminal body portion using two or more fasteners, and configured to hold the stacked current collecting plate group in a sandwiched manner between the terminal body portion of the terminal and the pressing member. The two or more fasteners each include a bolt extending in a stacking direction of the current collecting plates in the stacked current collecting plate group, and a nut. Herein, the bolt is structured such that: one end is fixed and a threaded portion to be engaged with the nut is formed at the other end; the nut is fixed to one end and a threaded portion is formed at the other end; or threaded portions are formed at both ends. Herein, the nut is not limited to a discrete component to be engaged with the threaded portion of the bolt, and may be structured as a female thread portion formed in the terminal body portion. The fasteners used in the present invention are provided such that one or more of the fasteners are located in each of two attachment regions spaced apart at a predetermined interval. Here, the term “attachment region” means a virtual space region in which the bolt and the nut are screwed to each other. The terminal body portion has at least one opposed surface of the terminal body portion that faces the pressing member. The pressing member has an opposed surface of the pressing member that faces the terminal body portion. In the present invention, at least one of the opposed surface of the terminal body portion and the opposed surface of the pressing member has a projecting surface to project toward the other of the opposed surfaces of the terminal body portion and the pressing member. The projecting surface is formed in a region located between the two attachment regions. According to the present invention, when the pressing member is moved toward the terminal body portion using the fasteners provided in the two attachment regions located on both sides of the projecting surface, both end portions of the pressing member located on both sides of the projecting surface are deformed by an amount corresponding to the projecting length of the projecting surface. Because of the deformation, the center portion of the pressing member facing the projecting surface via the stacked current collecting plate group is caused to strongly contact the stacked current collecting plate group over substantially the entire portion. As a result, according to the present invention, the contact resistance between the two adjacent current collecting plates in the stacked current collecting plate group and the contact resistance between the stacked current collecting plate group and the pressing member can be significantly reduced compared to the related art to significantly reduce the amount of heat generated by the terminal structure, to a greater degree than in a configuration in which the stacked current collecting plate group is simply held in a sandwiched manner between the terminal body portion and the pressing member.', 'The projecting surface may be provided on one of the opposed surfaces of the terminal body portion and the pressing member. In this case, the projecting length of the projecting surface from a non-projecting surface of the one of the opposed surfaces of the terminal body portion and the pressing member is preferably 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm. If the projecting length of the projecting surface is less than 0.1 mm, the effect of providing the projecting surface may be hardly obtained depending on the number of the current collecting plates. If the projecting length of the projecting surface is more than 0.5 mm, meanwhile, a portion of a pressing plate facing the projecting surface may be curved outward to reduce the effect in reducing the contact resistance depending on the number of the current collecting plates. If the projecting length of the projecting surface is within such a numerical range, the amount of generated heat can be reduced by 20% or more compared to a case where the projecting surface is not provided.', 'The projecting surface is preferably a continuous surface. If the projecting surface is a continuous surface, the contact resistance can be further reduced. As a matter of course, the projecting surface may also be discontinuous. The projecting surface preferably has an area that is 60% to 80% of an area of the opposed surfaces of the terminal body portion and the pressing member.', 'Base portions of the bolts of the fasteners may be fixed to one of the terminal body portion and the pressing member, and the other of the terminal body portion and the pressing member may be formed with through holes through which the bolts pass. In this case, the nuts are screwed to threaded portions of the bolts projecting from the through holes. With such a configuration, the pressing member and the terminal body portion can be positioned by inserting the bolts into the through holes. Thus, the terminal structure for a secondary battery can be easily formed.', 'Alternatively, the pressing members may each be formed with through holes through which the bolts pass, and the terminal body portion may be formed with hole portions in which female threads are formed to function as the nuts when the threaded portions of the bolts are screwed into the hole portions. With such a configuration, the terminal body portion can be used as the nuts. Therefore, the bolts can be easily attached to the terminal body portion by simply inserting male thread portions at the distal end of the bolts into female thread portions formed in the terminal body portion and rotating the bolts.', 'Still alternatively, the current collecting plates may each be formed with through holes through which the bolts pass. With this configuration, the stacked current collecting plate group can be easily positioned.', 'In order to electrically connect a larger number of electrodes to the terminal portion, stacked current collecting plate groups may be respectively attached to two surfaces of the terminal body portion. Specifically, the at least one opposed surface of the terminal body portion comprises the two opposed surfaces of the terminal body portion that are opposite to each other in the stacking direction, and the at least one pressing member comprises two pressing members respectively provided to face the two opposed surfaces of the terminal body portion. In this case, a predetermined number of the plurality of tabs of the plurality of electrodes of the same polarity in the electrode group are welded to each of the plurality of current collecting plates. The plurality of current collecting plates are divided into two groups and stacked to constitute two stacked current collecting plate groups. One of the stacked current collecting plate groups is held in a sandwiched manner between one of the opposed surfaces of the terminal body portion and one of the pressing members. The remaining one of the stacked current collecting plate groups is held in a sandwiched manner between the remaining one of the opposed surfaces of the terminal body portion and the remaining one of the pressing members. With such a configuration, the stacked current collecting plate groups can be respectively held on the two surfaces of the terminal body portion that are opposite to each other in the stacking direction, which makes it possible to support an increase in number of electrodes.', 'If the stacked current collecting plate groups are divided and connected to the two surfaces, the terminal body portion is formed with a plurality of through holes that each open in the two opposed surfaces of the terminal body portion. In addition, the two pressing members are each formed with a plurality of through holes aligned with the plurality of through holes formed in the terminal body portion. The bolts having threaded portions at both ends are disposed to pass through the through holes formed in the terminal body portion and the through holes formed in the pressing members, and the nuts are screwed with both ends of the bolts. With such a configuration, the two pressing members can be easily attached to the terminal body portion by simply screwing the nuts from both sides.', 'Normal bolts having a threaded portion at one end portion may be used in place of the bolts having threaded portions at both ends. In this case, the bolts having a threaded portion at an end portion are disposed to pass through the through holes formed in the terminal body portion and the through holes formed in the pressing members. Base portions of the bolts contact one of the pressing members. The nuts contact the remaining one of the pressing members.

"In the first excimer lamp of the present invention, one of the electrodes is disposed inside the light-emitting tube, and the other electrode is disposed in the tube wall of the light-emitting tube. Therefore, dielectric barrier discharge can be generated between the pair of electrodes, so radiation light can be obtained by utilizing the dielectric barrier discharge. Since any of the pair of electrodes are not exposed to the outside of the light-emitting tube, the electrodes do not come into contact with gas, liquid, etc. that is present outside the light-emitting tube according to the use environment, so no harmful effects occur which are caused when the electrodes are exposed to the outside of the light-emitting tube. Since the one electrode and the other electrode face each other in a reliable manner irrespective of the embedded position of the other electrode in the tube wall of the light-emitting tube, stable discharge is obtained in the inner space of the light-emitting tube.', 'A hermetically sealed portion having a foil seal structure in which a conductive foil electrically connected to the one electrode is embedded is formed in an end portion of the light-emitting tube. In this configuration, the one electrode and the light-emitting tube are not in direct contact with each other in the hermetically sealed portion. Therefore, when the lamp emits light, although thermal expansion occurs in the one electrode and the conductive foil, the thermal expansion in the one electrode and the conductive foil can be absorbed by plastic deformation of the conductive foil and thereby relaxed. Therefore, the occurrence of breakage of the hermetically sealed portion due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the material of the electrodes, the material of the conductive foil and the material of the light-emitting tube can be suppressed.', 'In the first excimer lamp of the present invention, no corrosion occurs in the electrodes in any use environment, and high safety can thereby be obtained. In addition, since the occurrence of breakage of the end portion of the light-emitting tube in which the hermetic seal structure is formed is suppressed, long service life is obtained.', 'In the second excimer lamp of the present invention, one of the electrodes is disposed in the hermetic space inside the cylindrical tube made of a dielectric material so as to be in contact with the inner surface of the tube wall of the cylindrical tube, and the other electrode is disposed so as to face the one electrode through the tube wall of the cylindrical tube and the light-emitting space.

The occurrence of breakage of the hermetically sealed portions due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the material of the electrodes, the material of the conductive foils and the material of the light-emitting tube can thereby be suppressed. Since the cylindrical tube disposed with the one electrode in contact therewith can have a large capacitance, the pair of electrodes can be supplied with large electric power, and the light-emitting space can thereby be supplied with larger electric power. Moreover, since each of the hermetically sealed portions at the ends of the light-emitting tube has a foil seal structure, these hermetically sealed portions can be easily formed by pinch sealing or shrink sealing.', 'Therefore, according to the second excimer lamp of the present invention, the light-emitting space can be supplied with large electric power.

In addition, the cylindrical tube can be held at a prescribed placement position inside the light-emitting tube.', 'In the second excimer lamp of the present invention, the one electrode is formed into a coil shape. Therefore, even when the area of contact between the one electrode and the cylindrical tube is increased to increase the capacitance of the cylindrical tube, thermal expansion generated in the one electrode when the lamp emits light can be absorbed at least partially by the one electrode itself, i.e., the coil shape thereof. This can suppress the occurrence of breakage of the cylindrical tube due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the material of the electrodes and the material of the cylindrical tube.', 'In the third excimer lamp of the present invention, the pair of electrodes are disposed inside the light-emitting tube and are not exposed to the outside of the light-emitting tube.

"To solve the problems, the present invention provides a method for evaluating a concentration of a defect in a silicon single crystal substrate, the defect being formed by particle beam irradiation in the silicon single crystal substrate, comprising the steps of: measuring a resistivity of the silicon single crystal substrate, followed by irradiating the silicon single crystal substrate with the particle beam, re-measuring resistivity of the silicon single crystal substrate after the irradiation; determining each carrier concentration in the silicon single crystal substrate before and after the irradiation on the basis of the measured results of resistivity before and after the particle beam irradiation to calculate a rate of change of the carrier concentration; and evaluating a concentration of a VV defect on the basis of the rate of the change of the carrier concentration, the VV defect being comprised of a silicon atom vacancy and being formed by the particle beam irradiation in the silicon single crystal substrate.', 'As described above, the present invention can evaluate the VV defect concentration on the basis of measurement of the resistivities before and after the particle beam irradiation and the rate of the change of the carrier concentration obtained by the measured resistivities, and is a very simple evaluation method accordingly.

"However, the noise filter according to the conventional art has the following problems. That is, since the noise filter according to the conventional art uses the stray static capacitance generated between the common mode choke coils and the electric conductor as a line bypass capacitor, a capacitor is connected in parallel between the main circuit pattern and the ground potential part equivalently. As a result, since the cutoff frequency shifts to the low frequency side, the noise attenuation characteristics of the noise filter are improved in the low frequency band. However, since the impedance (1/jωC) of the capacitor component becomes low in the high frequency band, the noise current having flowed to the ground potential part through a certain capacitor returns again to the main circuit pattern through another capacitor from the ground potential part, thereby degrading the noise attenuation characteristics of the noise filter in the high frequency band. In addition, the noise assumed by the noise filter according to the conventional art is conducted noise and effects of radiation noise are not considered. Therefore, in the conventional art, when a noise source is present in the vicinity of the filter, radiation noise from the noise source is mixed into the main circuit pattern. Accordingly, even if the conventional noise filter attenuates conducted noise, radiation noise is mixed into the main circuit pattern after passage through the filter, thereby degrading EMC performance.', 'Conventionally, the noise attenuation characteristics of a noise filter have not been analyzed in detail and have been addressed mainly in a cut-and-try method, so the cause of degradation of noise attenuation characteristics has not been identified. However, the analysis by the inventors et al. has identified the cause of degradation of noise attenuation characteristics of the conventional noise filter as described above.', 'The invention addresses the above problems of the conventional noise filter with an object of providing a noise filter that improves noise attenuation characteristics in consideration of radiation noise in addition to conducted noise without using a special circuit.",2

"According to the aspect of the present invention, the first and second cases are arranged in an L-shape above the engine. Thus, the first and second cases can be arranged dispersedly in a space above the engine. Consequently, the top surface side of the engine device can be made low. Thus, upsizing of the engine device including the exhaust gas purification device can be suppressed or reduced, and the engine device having a compact size can be mounted in a limited space of an engine room of, e.g., a work machine.', 'According to the aspect of the present invention, the turbocharger and the first case can be compactly disposed above the exhaust manifold. Consequently, the top surface side of the engine device can be made low. In addition, a passage from an outlet of the exhaust manifold to the first case can be made shorter. Furthermore, the turbocharger and the first case can be rigidly supported at a side surface of the engine via the exhaust manifold.', 'According to the aspect of the present invention, the second case is disposed above the flywheel housing. Consequently, the second case can also be disposed compactly in the space above the flywheel housing. Thus, upsizing of the engine device including the exhaust gas purification device can be suppressed or reduced.', 'According to the aspect of the present invention, the second case is disposed below the first case, and the first case and the second case are connected to each other via the urea mixing tube in the position in which the first case and the second case overlap each other in a plan view. Consequently, the connected portion between the first case and the second case can be made shorter. This makes it possible to suppress or reduce the phenomenon that an exhaust gas passing through the urea mixing tube is influenced by a temperature of outside air, thereby making it possible to reduce the phenomenon that a crystal lump of a urea component is formed in the exhaust gas purification device. Consequently, it is possible to easily prevent an increase in exhaust resistance in the exhaust gas purification device that may otherwise be caused by, e.g., growth of the urea crystal lump.', 'According to the aspect of the present invention, the urea-water injection body is mounted in the first case, so that the urea-water injection body and the first case can be constituted as a single unit. This makes it easier to perform an assembling work for mounting the exhaust gas purification device onto the engine device.', 'According to the aspect of the present invention, the second case is provided with the SCR filter. Thus, the collecting filter can be omitted from the first case. Accordingly, the first case can be downsized. Consequently, the engine device including the exhaust gas purification device can be made compact.', 'According to the aspect of the present invention, the urea-water injection body is mounted in the first case, so that the urea-water injection body and the first case can be constituted as a single unit. This makes it easier to perform an assembling work for mounting the exhaust gas purification device onto the engine device. In addition, according to the aspect of the present invention, both the ends of the urea mixing tube are respectively inserted into the first and second cases. Consequently, the inside of the urea mixing tube can be maintained at a high temperature by a temperature atmosphere of the exhaust gas. This makes it possible to suppress or reduce crystallization of a urea component in urea water having been injected into the urea mixing tube.', 'According to the aspect of the present invention, the exhaust introduction opening is provided on the tube wall of the urea mixing tube. Consequently, a flow velocity of an exhaust gas flowing through the urea mixing tube can be made uniform, and thus urea water sprayed from the urea-water injection body toward the inside of the urea mixing tube is more likely to be stirred and dispersed. This improves the evaporativity of the urea component at a low temperature, and also enhances the reaction efficiency between the exhaust gas and the urea component.', 'According to the aspect of the present invention, the outlet-side end of the urea mixing tube has a squeezed shape. Consequently, urea water is caused to collide with an inner wall surface of the outlet-side end of the urea mixing tube. This allows evaporation of an unreacted urea component, thereby making it possible to facilitate a reaction between the exhaust gas and the urea component in the second case. In addition, due to the configuration in which the outlet-side end of the urea mixing tube is apart from the second case, it is possible to prevent the urea component from reaching an inner wall surface of the second case, thereby making it possible to suppress or reduce the phenomenon that a crystal lump is formed on the inner wall surface of the second case.', 'According to the aspect of the present invention, the mixer internally included in the urea mixing tube is positioned in the first case or the second case. This makes it possible to suppress or reduce a temperature drop in the mixer. In addition, since the exhaust gas whose flow velocity has been made uniform in the urea mixing tube flows into the mixer, a rotation performance of the mixer is made uniform. This facilitates mixing of the urea water with the exhaust gas, thereby making it possible to enhance the evaporativity of the urea component. Thus, it is possible to prevent crystallization of the urea component at the mixer. Not only this, it is also possible to facilitate a reaction between the exhaust gas and the urea component, and to suppress or reduce the phenomenon that the urea water in the form of droplets enters the second case.', 'According to the aspect of the present invention, the second case is disposed below the first case, and the first case and the second case are connected to each other via the urea mixing tube in the position in which the first case and the second case overlap each other in a plan view. Consequently, the connected portion between the first case and the second case can be made shorter. This makes it possible to suppress or reduce the phenomenon that an exhaust gas passing through the urea mixing tube is influenced by a temperature of outside air, thereby making it possible to reduce the phenomenon that a crystal lump of a urea component is formed in the exhaust gas purification device. Consequently, it is possible to easily prevent an increase in exhaust resistance in the exhaust gas purification, device that may otherwise be caused by, e.g., growth of the urea crystal lump.",1
"According to the power converter in the one embodiment of the present invention, the commutation device capable of performing the commutation operation is provided, and hence the current flowing through the voltage changing device may be commutated to the other path. Consequently, for example, in the operation of the voltage changing device, a recovery current flowing from the load side (smoothing device side) to the voltage changing device side (power source side) may be reduced, and hence, for example, irrespective of the current capacity and other characteristics of an element used for the voltage changing device, loss by the current, namely, conduction loss, may be reduced through appropriate design of the configuration. In this case, the commutation device is configured so that the current generating the voltage causing reverse recovery of the rectifier may flow through the commutation device, and hence the loss in the commutation operation not directly contributing to the power conversion (voltage change) may be further reduced.

"For example, in a gas sensor device that measures physical quantities of intake air passing through an intake passage of an internal combustion engine, an ambient temperature of a place where the gas sensor device is disposed greatly changes depending on temperature changes caused by changes in running environment and depending on driving conditions such as the presence or absence of intake supercharging by a supercharger. Therefore, a gas sensor device requires a measurement accuracy good enough to respond to temperature changes.', 'The gas sensor device disclosed in PTL 1 uses the second heater to reduce measuring errors caused by changes in ambient temperature.

"However, there are a large number of operation workload reallocating plans, but in terms of a required calculation amount (workload x time), it is undesirable to, in each case, derive power consumption required for a cooling apparatus, select and control operation workload deployment for minimizing a total value of the derived power consumption and server power. Namely, because strict calculation (simulation) of required power consumption is extremely time-consuming, it is inefficient to calculate power consumption in accordance with a slight change in IT equipment deployment. Even if IT equipment deployment which achieves maximum possible reduction in the power consumption can be obtained, a resultant enormous calculation amount to achieve this is more undesirable.

"In the technique described in PTL 1, a response of a cooling capacity of a cryocooler is slower compared to control by heat generation of a heater, and it is difficult to maintain pressure in a helium vessel constant. Therefore, as described in PTL 1, pressure changes within a range (between an upper limit value and a lower limit value) of predetermined pressure. Thus, a slight change of magnetic field performance in a superconducting magnet follows a change of pressure in the helium vessel, which must be accepted.', 'Also, the technique described in PTL 1 drastically changes a cryocooler control amount (a frequency value of a cooling cycle, ON/OFF of power supply to a cryocooler, and a supply amount of compressed refrigerant gas) stepwise if pressure in a helium vessel is nearing an upper limit value and a lower limit value of predetermined pressure. If a cooling capacity of a cryocooler is increased drastically, refrigerant gas pressure of the cryocooler transitionally becomes high and results in an overload operation of a compressor unit. The overload operation of the compressor unit thermally decomposes internal lubricant oil, which generates methane gas (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen gas (H2). These decomposed gases cannot be removed completely with an incorporated filter, gets mixed in with refrigerant gas, reaches a cold head, freezes in the cold head, and then results in causes of a cold head failure and cooling capacity deterioration. This phenomenon is referred to as impurity contamination and is a cause of life shortening of a cryocooler.', 'The present invention was made by considering the above problems, and the purpose is to extend the lifetime of a cooler (cryocooler), to reduce down periods of an MRI apparatus due to cooler maintenance, and to improve the operation rate of an MRI apparatus.', 'Solution to Problem', 'In order to solve the above problems, an MRI apparatus of the present invention includes: a superconducting magnet that generates a static magnetic field in an imaging space; a gradient magnetic field coil that applies a gradient magnetic field to an imaging space; a high-frequency coil that applies a high-frequency magnetic field to an imaging space; and a control unit that controls operations of a gradient magnetic field coil and a high-frequency coil to execute a predetermined imaging sequence. The superconducting magnet includes a refrigerant vessel to accommodate a refrigerant and a superconducting coil, a cooler that is connected to the refrigerant vessel and re-condenses refrigerant gas vaporized in the refrigerant vessel, and a detector to detect pressure in the refrigerant vessel. The control unit compares a pressure value detected by the detector with a predetermined set pressure value and continuously performs feedback control that increases a cooling capacity of the cooler if the pressure value is higher than the set pressure value and that reduces a cooling capacity of the cooler if the pressure value is lower than the set pressure value to maintain a thermal equilibrium state at the set pressure value.",2
"One of the performance requirements of the golf club is a flying distance. An increase in the flying distance is an important development factor, particularly, in view of a driver in a driving shot. In the case of a human player, the flying distance may be adjusted by the swing of arms and the sway of the hips. The golf club testing machines disclosed in Application Nos. 07-336153 and 08-019176 have no rotary portion analogous to the sway of the hips, and thus adjust the flying distance only by the operation of the swing arm mechanism. More specifically, the rotational speed of the swing arm mechanism is adjusted by adjusting the output of a motor to control the flying distance. To increase the flying distance, a high-powered motor is needed. The high-powered motor is heavy. If the center of gravity of an entire device is appropriately balanced, the resulting apparatus becomes inevitably large.', 'Mere amplification of the output of the motor of the swing arm mechanism is not sufficient to maximize the flying distance performance of the golf club. To increase the flying distance, not only the initial speed of a golf ball is increased, but also appropriate spinning is imparted to the golf ball. Human players impart appropriate spinning to the golf ball by swaying their hips.', 'The golf club testing machine disclosed in Application No. 2000-202871 swings a golf club only by rotating a barrel section. The golf club testing machine cannot maximize the flying distance performance of the golf club.', 'The golf club testing machine disclosed in Application No. 2005-262515, including the swing arm mechanism of Application Nos. 07-336153 and 08-019176 and the barrel rotary mechanism of Application No. 2000-202871, maximizes the flying distance performance, thereby resulting in an ideal swing.', 'The machine disclosed in Application No. 2005-262515 has also a problem to be solved. The machine includes a hit assisting mechanism on a base foot section. The hit assisting mechanism rotates in a horizontal plane a base section immediately thereabove. The base section supports a lower barrel section in a manner such that the lower barrel section is height-adjustable. The lower barrel section supports an upper section in a manner that allows the upper section to be adjustable in a forwardly inclined angle. The swing arm mechanism is arranged on the upper section. The hit assisting mechanism horizontally rotates all the mechanisms above the base section in unison with the swing arm mechanism. During a test swing, a relatively high load is applied to the hit assisting mechanism, thereby adversely affecting stability of the hit assisting mechanism.', 'Another object of the golf club testing machine including the swing arm mechanism is to increase the efficiency of the test swing. The golf club testing machine having the swing arm mechanism has an angle of rotation of about 200 degrees from an address position to a follow-through position thereof. In the case of a full swing, the angle of rotation becomes 230 degrees or more. For a next swing operation, a known golf club testing machine causes the motor to rotate in a direction opposite to the swing direction, thereby returning the swing arm mechanism from the follow-through position to the address position. It takes time to cause the swing arm mechanism to revert to the address position.', 'Another challenge is that the golf club testing machine needs to hold the golf club correctly. When a human player grasps a golf club, the player adjusts appropriately the positions of the hands, and the fingers, and the bending and gripping force of the fingers. But it is difficult to require that the golf club testing machine practice such a complex human manner of gripping. However, the development of the golf club testing machines has been recently so much in progress that a swing motion closer to that of a human becomes possible. In view of this, the holding position of the golf club is preferably closer to the human manner of grasping.', 'The holder structure disclosed in Application No. 09-362686 is largely different from the human manner of grasping in the points described below. In a first different point, a human player holds the grip of the golf club at two locations, upper and lower points, with both hands while the device disclosed in Application No. 09-362686 holds entirely or at one location the grip with a pair of holder members that are to engage with each other. In a next different point, the human player adjusts grasping force by each hand, each finger, and each thumb, while the device disclosed in Application No. 09-362686 grasps uniformly the external surface of the grip. In the case of the human player, localized deformation and stress concentration may take place on the grip during the swing while Application No. 09-362686 states that neither localized deformation nor stress concentration takes place on the device. Even a golf club testing machine performing a swing closest possible to that of a human player, and having the holder structure of Application No. 09-362686 may generate deformation and stress different from those caused by the human manner of grasping. As a result, there is a possibility that the device of Application No. 09-362686 fails to evaluate the performance of a golf club and a grip thereof designed on the premise that the golf club is used by a human player.', 'The objects of the present invention is to solve the plurality of problems described above. More specifically, a first object of the present invention is to perform stably a hip turning motion for increasing the flying distance. A second object is to shorten the returning time from the follow-through position to the address position. A third object is to make the holding manner of the grip of the golf club closer to the human holding manner.",2

In this state, when a main fixing sheet portion interposed between the pair of preliminary fixing sheet piece portions is bonded to the electric wire bundle, the main fixing sheet portion is fixed to the electric wire bundle at an exact position.

When the sheet base material is fixed to the electric wire bundle, the preliminary fixing sheet piece portion and the main fixing sheet portion have the same width or the same diameter.

In a state where the sheet base material is located with respect to the electric wire bundle, the main fixing sheet portion is wound around a center portion of the electric wire bundle, and thus it is possible to locate and fix the sheet base material at an exact position with respect to the linear electric wire bundle.

"It is known that a cathode active material used for cathode active material layers of secondary batteries experiences expansion and contraction since it occludes and releases ions upon charge and discharge. However, it is thought that when space is present between the particles of the cathode active material, the expansion and contraction of the cathode active material are absorbed by this space.', 'Meanwhile, in the case of the cathode active material layer of an all-solid-state secondary battery, from the viewpoint of obtaining high ion conductivity between the cathode active material and the solid electrolyte, the contact (adhesion) property between the particles of the cathode active material and the particles of the solid electrolyte is preferably high. Accordingly, in the production of the cathode of the all-solid-state secondary battery, to increase the contact property between the cathode active material particles and the solid electrolyte particles, it is required to minimize the space between the cathode active material particles and the solid electrolyte particles by applying a high forming pressure to a mixture containing the cathode active material particles and the solid electrolyte particles. As a result, however, the space between the cathode active material particles is decreased, so that the expansion and contraction of the cathode active material is less likely to absorbed upon charge and discharge, and problems such as cracking of the cathode active material, cracking of the cathode active material layer, and a decrease in the contact property between the cathode active material particles and the solid electrolyte particles are caused, and thus the capacity retention rate of the secondary battery is decreased.', 'In the case where, as with Patent Literature 1, a method of applying and drying a slurry is used to produce a cathode active material layer containing a cathode active material and a solid electrolyte, there is such a problem that the capacity retention rate is decreased. Also, the process of drying the slurry requires large scale equipment upon mass production, and there is a problem of high production cost.', 'The present invention was achieved in light of the above circumstances. The present invention is to provide: a cathode for secondary batteries which has a high capacity retention rate; a method for producing a cathode for secondary batteries; and an all-solid-state secondary battery comprising the cathode.",2

"In the discharge tube according to the present invention, the discharge electrode portions of the first and third electrodes that are disposed opposite to each other with a predetermined discharge gap provided in between are inserted and arranged in the through-hole of the second electrode. Thus, no discharge is generated between the first electrode and the second electrode, and between the third electrode and the second electrode as in the conventional discharge tube, but a discharge can be readily generated in the discharge gap between the discharge electrode portions of the first and third electrodes, while a discharge response characteristic is improved when a voltage is applied because of increasing an electric field by arranging the discharge gap that generates a discharge in the through-hole of the second electrode.', 'Note that in the discharge tube described above, that if the insertion length of the discharge electrode portions of the first and third electrodes inserted in the through-hole of the second electrode is set two times or more the gap length of the discharge gap, it will contribute to the improvement of a discharge response characteristic, because the discharge gap is disposed in a position where the electric field is high inside the through-hole.', 'In the discharge tube of the present invention, improvement of a discharge response characteristic can be realized when a voltage is applied, by forming a film that contains cesium nitrate, rubidium nitrate, magnesium oxide and glass, on the end surface of the discharge electrode portion.', 'In the discharge tube of the present invention, a discharge response characteristic is improved when a voltage is applied, by using a discharge gas composed of neon in the range of 40 to 80% by volume, argon in the range of 5 to 50% by volume, hydrogen in the range of 1 to 50% by volume, and the pressure of the filled gas against the airtight outer enclosure is in the range of 25 to 100 kPa.', 'In the discharge tube of the present invention, on an inner wall surface of the first tubular body, a first trigger discharge film a back end of which is directly connected to the first electrode and a second trigger discharge film a back end of which is directly connected to the second electrode are formed, and on an inner wall surface of the second tubular body, a first trigger discharge film a back end of which is directly connected to the third electrode and a second trigger discharge film a back end of which is directly connected to the second electrode are formed. Thus, since the back ends of the first and second trigger discharge films are directly connected to any of the first, second and third electrodes, electric field concentration is strong on the ends of the first trigger discharge film and the second trigger discharge film so that a high volume of electrons can be emitted, thereby improving a discharge response characteristic when a voltage is applied.', 'In the discharge tube, by arranging the first trigger discharge film formed on the inner wall surface of the first tubular body and the second trigger discharge film formed on the inner wall surface of the second tubular body on the same plane, and by arranging the first trigger discharge film formed on the inner wall surface of the second tubular body, and the second trigger discharge film formed on the inner wall surface of the first tubular body on the same plane, a discharge response characteristic can be improved, because creeping corona discharge can be generated inside the first tubular body 18 and inside the second tubular body 20, even in either case when a voltage to shift away from the first electrode to the third electrode is applied or when a voltage to shift away from the third electrode to the first electrode is applied.', 'In other words, in the case when voltage to shift away from the first electrode to the third electrode is applied, an electric field concentrates on the end of the first trigger discharge film in the first tubular body and electrons are emitted, creeping corona discharge is then generated between the end of the first trigger discharge film and the second electrode, while an electric field concentrates on the end of the second trigger discharge film in the second tubular body and electrons are emitted, creeping corona discharge is then generated between the end of the second trigger discharge film and the third electrode.', 'In addition, in the case when voltage to shift away from the third electrode to the first electrode is applied, an electric field concentrates on the end of the first trigger discharge film in the second tubular body and electrons are emitted, creeping corona discharge is then generated between the end of the first trigger discharge film and the second electrode, while an electric field concentrates on the end of the second trigger discharge film in the first tubular body and electrons are emitted, creeping corona discharge is then generated between the end of the second trigger discharge film and the first electrode.",1

"As mentioned above, the present invention is concerned with communication of information between devices in a cellular network where direct device-to-device communication is allowed under cellular network control and management.', 'More specifically, in a first form, the present invention relates broadly to a wireless communication system comprising:', 'a cellular network including one or more access nodes, and', 'user equipments (UEs) which can operate in a cellular mode where data is transmitted from one UE to another via one or more of the access nodes, and at least some UEs are device-to-device (D2D) capable UEs (D2D-UEs) which can also operate in a direct communication mode where a pair of D2D-UEs transmit data directly from one to the other,', 'wherein D2D-UEs operating in the direct communication mode maintain control signalling connection with the cellular network, change to the cellular mode at one or more times and send channel state information (CSI) to the cellular network, and the cellular network uses CSI and/or network available geographical location information for D2D-UEs in determining whether to cause D2D-UEs to operate in the direct communication mode or to operate in the cellular mode.', 'A UE may operate in cellular mode if the other party (UE) is located far away or the link quality for direct communication is worse than that of the overlaid radio network. On the other hand, a D2D-UE may operate in direct communication (or D2D) mode if the pairing D2D-UE is sufficiently close and the link quality of the direct communication is (at least potentially) better than that of the overlaid cellular/radio network.', 'In the direct communication/D2D mode, two communicating D2D-UEs may share cellular network downlink or uplink resources with cellular mode UEs. Alternatively the two communicating D2D-UEs may use dedicated resources for direct communication. The said dedicated resources may be dedicated cellular uplink or dedicated cellular downlink resources on a primary carrier component or on a secondary carrier component or dedicated carrier component that are not a paired block of spectrum and not used for the overlaid cellular network uplink or downlink resources but being controllable by the overlaid cellular network. Preferably, in resources dedicated for D2D communications, no cellular mode communication should take place within a cell, a part of a network or the whole network.', 'It will be understood that, since any two communicating D2D-UEs may share cellular network downlink or uplink resources with cellular mode UEs or may operate on dedicated resources within dedicated cellular uplink or dedicated cellular downlink resources, it may be preferable that the overlaid cellular network can control any direct communication and thereby at least help to ensure the integrity and quality of the overall system and/or to provide an improvement in overall spectral efficiency. Furthermore, as any two communicating D2D-UEs may be subject to mobility (i.e. one or both may move), therefore the direct communication link may not always be guaranteed for the entire direct communication section and may degrade, especially when the two D2D communicating UEs move far away from each other or, for example, move into shadowing regions.

"As a result of thorough examination of the cause of the problems described in the above (1) to (4), the present inventors found that in the liquid crystal display panel disclosed in Non-Patent Literature 1, the problems described in the above (1) to (3) are caused because the size of the polymer is large, and the polymer forms a network structure not on the surface of the alignment film but in the entire liquid crystal layer.', 'That is, due to the polymer that is not adjacent to the alignment film and is present in bulk, the fixation of the liquid crystal alignment and the reduction in voltage effectively applied to the liquid crystal cause the shift to a high-voltage side as (1). Moreover, since the polymer is formed throughout the entire liquid crystal layer, light is scattered at the time of black display during which voltage is not applied, whereby the reduction in contrast as (2) is caused. In addition, because it is impossible to selectively fix liquid crystal alignment on the surface of the alignment film, the image sticking as (3) is caused.', 'Furthermore, the present inventors found that an unreacted material remaining in the liquid crystals, particularly, a polymerization initiator for polymerizing the photopolymerizable monomer is the cause of the problem (4) described above.', 'From the above results, the present inventors found that in order to solve the problems (1) to (3), it is necessary to suppress the formation of the bulky polymer by actively causing the polymer to be formed on the surface of the alignment film. As a method for doing this, the following method is considered. In this method, the concentration of the polymerization initiator is heightened to increase the density of polymerization starting points in the liquid crystal display panel, and the size of the polymer formed by light irradiation is reduced to cause the polymer to be rapidly precipitated from the liquid crystal layer, whereby the polymer is deposited onto the surface of the alignment film. However, heightening the concentration of the polymerization initiator is not preferable since doing such thing further negatively affects the electric characteristics of (4) described above.', 'As a result of further thorough examination, the present inventors found that if a polymerization-initiating function is imparted to the monomer without adding a polymerization initiator to the liquid crystals, the polymerization initiator which may become an impurity does not remain in the liquid crystals, so the electric characteristics are markedly improved. The present inventors also found that if the monomer itself has a polymerization-initiating function, the density of polymerization starting points in the liquid crystal display panel increases, and accordingly, due to a precipitating effect resulting from the decrease in solubility of the monomer in the liquid crystal layer that is caused when the monomer becomes an oligomer-like substance, the monomer is rapidly deposited onto the surface of the alignment film, whereby an extremely uniform polymer layer can be formed on the surface of the alignment film. In this manner, the present inventors found that the above problems can be excellently solved, thereby completing the present invention.', 'That is, an aspect of the present invention is a liquid crystal display device (hereinafter, also called a “first liquid crystal display device of the present invention”) including a pair of substrates, a liquid crystal layer interposed between the pair of substrates, a horizontal alignment film formed on at least one of the pair of substrates, and a polymer layer formed on the horizontal alignment film, wherein the polymer layer has a structure represented by the following chemical formula (1) in a repeating unit.', ",0

"In the turbines for a turbocharger disclosed in PTLs 1 and 2, the swelling regions of the rotor blades are eliminated, and the inclination angle is provided at the leading edges of the rotor blades. Therefore, the area of the rotor blades is reduced. Thus, there is a problem in that the swirling force of the swirling flow that flows in from the scroll chamber s cannot be efficiently transmitted to the rotor blades, and the efficiency of a turbocharger degrades. In order to recover the efficiency of the turbocharger, it is necessary to increase the area of the rotor blades on a trailing edge side, or to enlarge the scroll portion 150 to increase swirling energy of the swirling flow. However, this is counterproductive in terms of the size and weight reduction of the turbocharger.', 'Meanwhile, in the axial-flow turbine, the stator blades are attached to the inside of the turbine housing.

The total contained amount of the addition element is in a range of 0.010 to 5.0 atomic %.', 'With such a makeup of the aluminum-alloy plate, described as above, because the aluminum oxide film contains a predetermined content of zirconium, oxidation of the aluminum oxide film, in a humid environment, can be suppressed for a long time-period. By so doing, surface stability for a long time-period is obtained, and stability in wettability after degreasing can be maintained even after stored for a long time-period. Furthermore, because the aluminum oxide film contains a predetermined content of magnesium, and an addition element not less than 1.00 in P-B ratio, a pore is not formed on the aluminum oxide film to thereby render a microstructure more compact.

"The present invention aimed at solving the previously described problem is a diffraction grating to be used in a pulse compressor including two identically shaped diffraction gratings arranged parallel to each other with their respective grating surfaces facing each other in a laser device using a chirped pulse amplification method, wherein:', 'the diffraction grating is a reflective blazed diffraction grating having grooves with a sawtooth-shaped section covered with a reflective metallic coating at least on their surface, the diffraction grating having a blaze angle determined so that, at the wavelength of a laser pulse to be used, the incident angle of an incoming laser pulse and first order diffracted light form a relationship of mirror reflection with the groove slope, and a predetermined level of diffraction efficiency is obtained.', 'The first mode of the laser device according to the present invention aimed at solving the previously described problem is a laser device using a chirped pulse amplification method, the laser device using the diffraction grating according to the present invention as a diffraction grating in a pulse compressor, wherein:', 'the pulse compressor includes two identically shaped diffraction gratings provided as first and second diffraction gratings arranged parallel to each other with their respective grating surfaces facing each other and a mirror for receiving a laser pulse via the first and second diffraction gratings and for reflecting the laser pulse so that the laser pulse sequentially impinges on the second and first diffraction gratings, the two diffraction gratings arranged so that the laser pulse travelling from the second diffraction grating to the first diffraction grating impinges on the first diffraction grating at substantially right angles to the groove slope of the first diffraction grating.', 'In other words, the optical system of the pulse compressor in the first mode of the laser device has a double-path configuration.', 'The second mode of the laser device according to the present invention aimed at solving the previously described problem is a laser device using a chirped pulse amplification method, the laser device using the diffraction grating according to the present invention as a diffraction grating in a pulse compressor, wherein:', 'the pulse compressor is configured to extract a laser pulse via two identically shaped diffraction gratings provided as first and second diffraction gratings arranged parallel to each other with their respective grating surfaces facing each other, the two diffraction gratings arranged so that the laser pulse travelling from the first diffraction grating to the second diffraction grating impinges on the second diffraction grating at substantially right angles to the groove slope of the second diffraction grating.', 'In other words, the optical system of the pulse compressor in the second mode of the laser device has a single-path configuration.', 'In a reflective blazed diffraction grating having a grating surface with a sawtooth-shaped section, electromagnetic waves produced by a laser pulse are likely to be concentrated on the pointed ridge portion of the grating and damage the reflection coating at that portion. Taking this into account, in the diffraction grating according to the present invention, the blaze angle is determined so that a predetermined level of diffraction efficiency will be obtained at the wavelength of the laser pulse to be used, under the condition that the incident angle of an incoming laser pulse and first order diffracted light form the relationship of mirror reflection with the groove slope. Therefore, for example, when a pair of such diffraction gratings are used in a pulse compressor, it is possible to make a laser pulse impinge on each grating at substantially right angles to the groove slope.', 'Making the laser pulse impinge on the blazed diffraction grating at substantially right angles to the groove slope lowers the degree of concentration of the electromagnetic waves on the pointed ridge portion of the grating. Therefore, for example, as compared to the case where the laser pulse impinges on the grating in the direction normal to the grating surface, the reflection coating is less likely to be damaged. In other words, the damage threshold of the diffraction grating is improved. Therefore, a laser device using this diffraction grating in the pulse compressor allows the use of a higher amount of laser power. Furthermore, since the diffraction grating has a sufficiently high diffraction efficiency, only a low loss of energy of the laser pulse occurs in the pulse compressor. This is also advantageous for increasing the level of laser power. The diffraction grating according to the present invention does not require making the reflection coating unnecessarily thick to increase the damage threshold. Furthermore, it does not use a multilayer dielectric film whose production process is complex. Accordingly, the grating can be produced at a low cost.', 'The diffraction grating for laser pulse compression according to the present invention may preferably be a replicated diffraction grating having a grating surface created by forming a metallic reflection coating on the surface of the grating grooves of a master diffraction grating having grooves with a predetermined sawtooth-shaped section, making the metallic reflection coating in tight contact with a replica substrate via a resin material in between, and releasing the replica substrate from the master diffraction grating, with the metallic reflection coating in an inverted form adhered to the replica substrate.', 'By this process, diffraction gratings with stable performance can be obtained at a low cost.",0

"The present inventors have made diligent efforts to solve the aforementioned problems, and have found that a saccharified slurry obtainable after subjecting a slurry of cellulosic biomass to a hot water treatment can be dehydrated easily by putting it on a netlike plane such as a metal mesh after addition of a flocculant. The present inventors also found that saccharides in the residue can be easily eluted in washing water by spraying the washing water to the residue remaining on the netlike plane (dehydrated slurry residue). Further, the present inventors have found that by using a net conveyor belt, it becomes easy to wash the residue on the net conveyor belt plural times with washing water, and then conduct dehydration, and finally accomplished the present invention.', 'Concretely, the present invention relates to a method for recovering saccharides from a saccharified slurry, including:', 'a washing step of feeding a saccharified slurry containing C5 saccharides or C6 saccharides obtained by subjecting a slurry of cellulosic biomass to a hot water treatment in a supercritical state or subcritical state, on a conveyor having a net conveyor belt, dehydrating the saccharified slurry and spraying washing water to a dehydrated residue on the conveyor to dissolve C5 saccharides or C6 saccharides remaining in the residue in a washing liquid, wherein', 'the washing step washes the residue by spraying washing water to the residue from a plurality of washing water spraying units disposed in series in such a manner that the moving direction of the residue and the moving direction of the washing water are opposite to each other; and', 'the washing water having washed the residue is used as washing water of a washing water spraying unit neighboring in the direction opposite to the moving direction of the conveyor.', 'By feeding the saccharified slurry obtained after subjecting a slurry of cellulosic biomass to a hot water treatment on the net conveyor belt, the water drops downward from the net conveyor belt, and the saccharified slurry can be dehydrated rapidly.', 'The solid residue of the dehydrated saccharified slurry is moved by the net conveyor belt, and by spraying the washing water sequentially from the plurality of washing water spraying units to the residue so that the washing water is a counter flow, it is possible to wash the residue of the solid content with the washing water, and to efficiently recover saccharides from the solid residue. Since the sprayed washing water drops downward from the net conveyor belt, it is possible to increase the recovery amount of saccharides form the solid residue with little washing water by supplying the sprayed washing water to the washing water spraying unit neighboring in the direction opposite to the moving direction of the solid residue (conveyor conveyance direction). By increasing the thickness of the solid residue on the net conveyor belt, it is possible to increase the washing effect.', 'Preferably, an adding step of adding a flocculant to the saccharified slurry is further provided before the washing step.', 'By adding the flocculant to the saccharified slurry obtainable after subjecting a slurry of cellulosic biomass to a hot water treatment, the solid content in the saccharified slurry forms a floc. Thereafter, by feeding the saccharified slurry on the net conveyor belt, it is possible to dehydrate the saccharified slurry more rapidly.', 'Preferably, the net conveyor belt has a mesh ranging from 0.5 mm or more and 2.0 mm or less.', 'When the mesh is less than 0.5 mm, the water dehydrated from the saccharified slurry fails to drop rapidly from the net conveyor belt, and the dehydration can be insufficient. On the other hand, when the mesh is larger than 2.0 mm, part of the solid residue can fall off from the net conveyor belt together with the washing water.', 'Preferably, the number of the washing water spraying units is five or mote and twenty or less.', 'When the number of the washing water spraying units is four or less, saccharide recovery from the solid residue can be insufficient. On the other hand, disposing 21 or more washing water spraying units is problematic in the economical view. Practically, five or more and ten or less is more preferred.', 'Preferably, in the adding step, any one or any combination of two or more of a cationic flocculant, an anionic flocculant, a nonionic flocculant and an amphoteric flocculant is added at 0.1% by mass or higher and 2% by mass or lower with respect to a solid content of the saccharified slurry.', 'When the flocculant added to the saccharified slurry is less than 0.1% by mass with respect to the solid content of the saccharified slurry, flocculation is insufficient, and the solid in the saccharified slurry is difficult to form a floc. On the other hand, when it exceeds 2% by mass with respect to the solid content of the saccharified slurry, the problem arises that the cost of adding the flocculant increases, and the running cost rises.

"A problem herein is when a subject moves in a state in which the examination has to some extent been done. An example is shown in FIG. 23. Here, an imaging slice (1400) for main imaging is set using three scanogram images (1401, 1402, 1403) of axial (Ax), sagittal (SAG), and coronal (COL) images. A T1 weighted image (T1W), a T2 weighted image (T2W), and a FLAIR image (FLAIR) of the set imaging slice are acquired as diagnostic images in this order. In this case, images of the same part, such as images 1411, 1412, and 1413, are acquired if the subject can hold the same position during the examination. However, if the subject moves during the examination, parts reflected on the respective contrast images are different. As a result, since images 1421, 1422, and 1423 are acquired (in this example, FLAIR (1423) is different), there is a difficulty in diagnosis.', 'In such a case, it is necessary to capture a scanogram image again, under the current circumstances, so that the imaging slice is reset to the same position as the imaging slice before the subject moves. In practice, it is difficult to set the imaging slice to the completely same position manually, and it may be necessary to capture all images again in some cases. A timing at which the operator recognizes that the position of the subject has changed is after the imaging is completed and image reconstruction is finished. Therefore, images which cannot be used for an examination are captured and reconstructed uselessly. When using the automatic positioning function disclosed in NPL 1 in such a case, not only scanogram imaging but also 3D volume imaging is performed for every capturing of an image with each contrast during the examination.', 'As described above, in the case of performing an examination of capturing a plurality of images with different contrast for the same examination section in order to make a diagnosis by comparison, it is necessary to capture images including a scanogram image again and to reset an imaging slice if the subject moves during the examination, under the current circumstances. This increases the amount of operation and imaging time. In addition, since the timing at which the operator recognizes that the position of the subject has changed is after imaging, not only is there an increase in the amount of operation and an extension of the examination time but also the operation is wasteful in many cases.', 'The present invention has been made in view of the above situation, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a technique for accurately realizing an examination, which is for acquiring a plurality of images of the same examination section, without a complicated operation and an extension of the examination time.",2

That is, one rendering server which is assigned to the least number of terminals, for example, among the plurality of rendering servers is assigned for each client terminal that performs screen transmission requests to the server, and it performs rendering of game screens transmitted to that client terminal.', 'However, for rendered game screens, a calculation amount required for rendering processing differs depending on the type of the game, the scene in the game that is rendered, user settings, and the like. Accordingly, in a conventional approach such as where assignment is performed simply in accordance with the number of terminals that are connected, optimization of calculation resources of the rendering servers is not considered at all, and therefore processing delays may occur in a rendering server assigned to many rendering processes related to client terminals requesting game screens for which the calculation amount is large, for example. That is, rendering server assignment to client terminals has not been performed based on the perspective of optimization of rendering processing thus far.', 'The present invention was conceived in view of the above described problem, and it is an object to provide a rendering system, a control method, and a storage medium that decrease a calculation amount of rendering processing for screens transmitted to the client terminal suitably.",2

In the configuration, since the first flow channels and the second flow channels installed extendedly in the horizontal direction are connected through the bypass flow channels, it is possible to feed a cooling fluid from the first flow channels to the second flow channels. Consequently, it is possible to: reduce the number of the inlets and outlets of the flow channels; and allow the cooling fluid to flow easily.', 'Further, in a mold for continuous casting of a titanium or titanium alloy ingot according to the present invention, a cooling means may further have slow-cooling layers being embedded at four corner sections of the mold on a side closer to the inner peripheral surface of the mold than first flow channels respectively and having smaller thermal conductivity than the mold.

"Typically, as the types of heat transfer, there are heat conduction, heat transmission, and heat emission (radiation). In the underfloor fire of the railcar, the heat conduction and the radiation are major types of the heat transfer.', 'In the railcar described in PTL 1, the underfloor cover does not include a fireproof structure. If the underfloor fire occurs in this railcar, the car bodyshell made of an aluminum alloy is exposed to the fire to directly receive radiation heat transfer from the protective plate having high temperature.

To avoid such rapid temperature increase of the cross beam, the cross beam may have the fireproof structure described in PTL 2.

"In a case, as Patent Literature 5 to 7, where the amount of ink ejection is to be controlled for individual rows by a control circuit, however, it would be necessary to arrange channels in a same row such that pressure chambers face a same direction in order to facilitate wiring arrangement between the control circuit and the channels. In order to achieve high-density channel arrangement, there is a need to arrange channels including the pressure chambers facing different directions as described above.

"In the case of an imprint which uses a mold that has no flexibility, it is demanded that the mold and the transfer substrate be maintained as parallel to each other so that a residual film thickness in a resin layer, after being separated from the mold, becomes uniform. Further, in the case of a mold that has no flexibility, the mold is subject to strong peeling stress during separation from the resin layer as the surface area of the mold increases, which makes it difficult to separate the mold without causing defects in the pattern. As a result, in the case of the imprint mold that has no flexibility, there is a limit to increase the surface area of the imprint mold.', 'On the other hand, as an imprint method, a roller imprint is known, which is a method of creating a mold by forming a micro relief structure on a substrate having flexibility, allowing the mold to contact the resin composition by pressing the rear surface of the mold (surface on which the relief structure is not formed) using a roller, hardening the resin composition after contacting, then separating the hardened resin layer from the mold. In the case of the roller imprint, the surface area of the mold can easily be increased, compared with the imprint method using a mold that has no flexibility. However, a problem is that the pattern more easily deforms since the mold contacts with the resin composition by being pressed with a roller. Further, if the mold used for the roller imprint has a measurement pattern, which accompanies the main pattern to be formed, the measurement pattern also easily deforms, which makes it difficult to perform a desired measurement.', 'In manufacturing a wire grid polarizer using the imprint mold, a wire grid polarizer having a larger surface area can be manufactured if the roller imprint is used, compared with using a mold that has no flexibility. However, in the case of configuring a polarizing element unit by arraying a plurality of wire grid polarizers in a holding frame, aligning the micro metal in one direction, each of the wire grid polarizers has a respective difference, and a polarizing axis shifts from one another. Therefore, the polarizing axes must be aligned by aligning the positions of the individual wire grid polarizers. This positional alignment can be performed using a measurement pattern, for example, but if the measurement pattern is located in the main pattern region where micro metal wires are formed, linearly polarized light cannot be acquired in an area where the measurement pattern exists, and photo-alignment processing cannot be performed smoothly. If the measurement pattern, where linearly polarized light cannot be acquired, is disposed outside the main pattern where the micro metal wires are formed in order to solve the above problem, then the measurement pattern and the main pattern become distanced, and accurate positional alignment becomes difficult and/or an effective polarizing region decreases in a wire grid polarizer. Furthermore, as mentioned above, in the case of a roller imprint, the measurement pattern also more easily deforms, and the positional alignment accuracy of the wire grid polarizers decreases.', 'With the foregoing in view, it is an object of the present invention to provide an imprint mold which allows using a roller imprint, with suppressing the generation of defects, an imprint method using this mold, a wire grid polarizer of which position can be aligned at high precision, and a method for manufacturing this wire grid polarizer.",2

"A compressor pertaining to a first aspect of the invention comprises a compression chamber forming member, an injection passage, an injection pipe, and a pulsation attenuation space. The compression chamber forming member forms a compression chamber. The injection passage is formed in the compression chamber forming member and/or a separate member disposed in the surrounding area and connects to the compression chamber. The injection pipe supplies refrigerant to the injection passage. The pulsation attenuation space is formed, so as to communicate with the injection passage, in the compression chamber forming member or the separate member disposed in the surrounding area and attenuates pulsation of refrigerant gas flowing from the injection pipe into the compression chamber.', 'In this compressor, the pulsation attenuation space communicates with the injection passage, so pulsation during injection is attenuated by the pulsation attenuation space. As a result, it is no longer necessary to provide a muffler or the like on the outer side of the compressor, and a suppression of pipe vibration and a reduction in cost can be achieved.', 'A compressor pertaining to a second aspect of the invention is the compressor pertaining to the first aspect, wherein the compression chamber and the injection passage communicate with each other by an injection port. The pulsation attenuation space is an expansion chamber having a larger flow path cross-sectional area than the flow path cross-sectional area of the injection port.', 'In this compressor, the refrigerant expands when it flows into the expansion chamber, so pulsation of the refrigerant is reduced as a result. That is to say, the compression chamber fulfills a function as a muffler that suppresses pulsation of the refrigerant. Therefore, pulsation during injection is attenuated without providing a muffler or the like on the outer side of the compressor. As a result, a suppression of pipe vibration and a reduction in cost can be achieved.', 'A compressor pertaining to a third aspect of the invention is the compressor pertaining to the second aspect, wherein the ratio of a flow path cross-sectional area of the expansion chamber to a flow path cross-sectional area of the injection port is in the range of 2.0 to 50.', 'A compressor pertaining to a fourth aspect of the invention is the compressor pertaining to the second aspect, wherein the direction in which the refrigerant flows into the expansion chamber and the direction in which the refrigerant flows out of the expansion chamber intersect each other, and the injection port lies on an extension line of the direction in which the refrigerant flows out of the expansion chamber. A flow path cross section on the refrigerant outflow side of the expansion chamber and a flow path cross section of the injection port have a positional relationship where they are parallel to each other and the area centers of the flow path cross sections do not lie on the same axis.', 'In this compressor, in a case where the refrigerant flow direction bends in the expansion chamber, it becomes easier for the refrigerant to flow if the flow path cross section on the refrigerant outflow side of the expansion chamber and the flow path cross section of the injection port are not disposed on the same axis than if they are coaxial in their area centers.

"In a semiconductor element including a silicon carbide substrate, a metal electrode layer (for example, a stacked electrode of Ti/Ni/Ag) formed over the back surface thereof is disadvantageously likely to be delaminated from an ohmic electrode layer formed on the substrate. For example, when a wafer is diced by dicing, a large stress is applied to an interface between the soft metal layer and the solid semiconductor element in the bonded portion between the electrode over the back surface and the back surface of the semiconductor element. This is a cause of the delamination of the electrode over the back surface. When the semiconductor element is modularized, a stress is applied to the interface where the difference in thermal expansion coefficient is largest, resulting in the delamination of the electrode disposed over the back surface. Thus, if there is a reason for delamination of a metal electrode layer, the delamination proceeds due to a thermal stress in the manufacturing process thereof, and in some cases, the metal electrode layer is entirely delaminated from the back surface.', 'Patent Documents 1 and 2 described above considered improvement of reliability of the bonded portion by increasing the thickness of a solder layer. However, they fail to consider, in a semiconductor element including a silicon carbide substrate, the issue of bonding reliability between an electrode over the back surface and the back surface of the semiconductor element, i.e., the delamination issue of the metal electrode over the back surface, as described above.', 'The present disclosure can provide a semiconductor element including a silicon carbide substrate, the semiconductor element being capable of reducing delamination of a metal electrode layer disposed over a back surface of the substrate.",2
"The absorbent article according to the present invention is as follows. (1) An absorbent article which includes a longitudinal direction, a width direction, and a thickness direction that are mutually orthogonal to each other, including: an absorbent main body; a pair of side flaps that extend to both outer sides in the width direction of the absorbent main body; and a pair of leakage barriers that are disposed in the absorbent main body, wherein a direction toward and a direction away from a longitudinal direction central axis of the absorbent main body in the width direction are respectively an inner side direction and an outer side direction, the absorbent article further including: an elastic member which is joined in between the pair of side flaps in the absorbent main body, and is stretchable and shrinkable in the width direction, wherein each of the pair of leakage barriers includes: a standing portion in which an outer side in the width direction is a fixed end, and an inner side in the width direction is a free end, and a supporting portion which is adjacent to one side in the longitudinal direction of the standing portion and overlaps with the elastic member in the thickness direction, the supporting portion is fixed to the absorbent main body by a heat welding portion, and each of the pair of side flaps is folded to an inner side in the width direction at a position of a folding line which passes through the supporting portion and extends along the longitudinal direction in a plan view.', 'In the present absorbent article, the position of the folding lines at which the pair of side flaps are folded and the supporting portion are overlapped with each other in the thickness direction (or in a plan view). The supporting portion is a portion of each of the leakage barriers, is fixed to the absorbent main body by the heat welding portion, and is overlapped with the elastic member. Accordingly, the position of the folding lines is provided at a portion in which the supporting portion including the heat welding portion, the elastic member and the absorbent main body are overlapped with each other, that is, a portion with rigidity. Consequently, the pair of side flaps of the absorbent article are folded at the position of the folding lines at respective portions with rigidity, whereby when the pair of side flaps of the absorbent article are expanded, the folding creases can be suppressed from being formed at the position of the folding lines. As a result, when the absorbent article is worn, the gap between the absorbent article and the skin surface can be suppressed from being formed. Accordingly, the leakage of the excrement to the dorsal side and the tendency of the odor of the excrement being easily leaked to the dorsal side can be prevented.', 'The absorbent article according to the present invention may be (2) the absorbent article according to the above mentioned (1), wherein the supporting portion includes the heat welding portion which has predetermined widths on both sides in the width direction at the folding line.', 'In the present absorbent article, the heat welding portion of the supporting portion has the predetermined widths on both sides of the folding line, whereby even when the folding lines along the longitudinal direction are shifted in the width direction to some extent, the folding lines can more reliably pass through the heat welding portion. That is, the folding lines can more reliably pass through the portions with rigidity, whereby the folding creases can be even more suppressed from being formed at the position of the folding lines. Accordingly, the gap between the absorbent article and the skin surface can be even more suppressed from being formed.', 'The absorbent article according to the present invention may be (3) the absorbent article according to the above mentioned (2), wherein the supporting portion includes the heat welding portion which is formed from one end portion to the other end portion in the longitudinal direction of the supporting portion.', 'In the present absorbent article, the heat welding portion of the supporting portion is continuously or intermittently formed from one end portion to the other end portion in the longitudinal direction of the supporting portion, whereby the rigidity of the supporting portion through which the folding lines pass can be even more increased, and thus the folding creases can be even more suppressed from being formed at the position of the folding lines. Accordingly, the gap between the absorbent article and the skin surface can be even more suppressed from being formed.', 'The absorbent article according to the present invention may be (4) the absorbent article according to any one of the above mentioned (1) to (3), wherein the elastic member includes a highly stretching portion which is positioned in a center in the width direction, and a pair of less stretching portions which are positioned on both sides in the width direction and stretch less than the highly stretching portion, and the folding line overlaps with the highly stretching portion in the thickness direction.', 'In the present absorbent article, the position of the folding lines and the highly stretching portion in the elastic member overlap with each other in the thickness direction. The highly stretching portion is a portion in which the elastic member is adhered in a highly stretched state when being adhered to the sheet of the absorbent main body, and shrinks with the sheet in a natural state so as to be in a bellows shape and to form a number of wrinkles. That is, the highly stretching portion is relatively increased in the basis weight and has a higher rigidity compared to the less stretching portion. Accordingly, the position of the folding lines is provided at such portions with rigidity. Consequently, by folding the pair of side flaps of the absorbent article at the position of the folding lines at respective portions with rigidity, the folded portions can easily transition from the folded state to the expanded state when being worn, whereby the gap between the absorbent article and the skin surface can be suppressed from being formed. Accordingly, the leakage of the excrement to the dorsal side and the tendency of the odor of the excrement being easily leaked to the dorsal side can be prevented.', 'The absorbent article according to the present invention may be (5) the absorbent article according to any one of the above mentioned (1) to (4), wherein the folding line overlaps with at least a portion of an absorbent body in the absorbent main body in the thickness direction.', 'In the present absorbent article, the position of the folding lines and at least a portion of the absorbent body in the absorbent main body are overlapped with each other in the thickness direction. The absorbent body is somewhat separated from the end portion in the longitudinal direction in the dorsal side region of the absorbent main body, however, by the absorbent body also being bent when the side flaps are folded, the bending of the end portion in the longitudinal direction in the dorsal side region of the absorbent main body, in which the folding creases are easily formed, can be moderate. Accordingly, the suppression of the folding creases by making the folding lines pass through the supporting portion can be assisted. Consequently, the gap between the absorbent article and the skin surface can be suppressed from being formed. Accordingly, the leakage of the excrement to the dorsal side and the tendency of the odor of the excrement being easily leaked to the dorsal side can be prevented.', 'The absorbent article according to the present invention may be (6) the absorbent article according to any one of the above mentioned (1) to (5), further including a joining target portion which is joined to the other region in the longitudinal direction in the absorbent main body, and is to be a target of joining the pair of side flaps when being worn, wherein the folding line overlaps with the joining target portion in the thickness direction.', 'In the present absorbent article, the position of the folding lines and the joining target portion in the other region in the longitudinal direction in the absorbent main body, that is, the ventral side region are overlapped with each other in the thickness direction. That is, the folding lines (the folding positions) are provided at portions with rigidity. Consequently, by folding the pair of side flaps of the absorbent article at the position of the folding lines at respective portions with rigidity, the folded portions can easily transition from the folded state to the expanded state when being worn, whereby the gap between the absorbent article and the skin surface can be suppressed from being formed. Accordingly, the leakage of the excrement to the dorsal side and the tendency of the odor of the excrement being easily leaked to the dorsal side can be prevented.', 'The absorbent article according to the present invention may be (7) the absorbent article according to any one of the above mentioned (1) to (6), wherein the absorbent main body includes a top sheet, a back sheet, and an absorbent body which is positioned in between the top sheet and the back sheet, and the elastic member is positioned closer to a top sheet side than the absorbent body, in between the top sheet and the back sheet, overlaps with the absorbent body in the thickness direction, and is not joined to the absorbent body.', 'In the present absorbent article, the elastic member is positioned closer to the top sheet side than the absorbent body, overlaps with the absorbent body in the thickness direction, however, is not joined to the absorbent body. Accordingly, the elastic member can shrink without receiving influence of the absorbent body. Since the elastic member is positioned close to the end portion in the longitudinal direction in the dorsal side region of the absorbent main body, in which the folding creases are easily formed, the folding creases can be suppressed by the shrinkage of the elastic member when the absorbent article is worn, whereby the gap between the absorbent article and the skin surface can be suppressed from being formed.",0

"In recent years, achieving higher luminance, higher efficiency, and a longer life of an organic electroluminescent element has been a major challenge, and organic electroluminescent elements with a multiunit structure have attracted much attention. Since the multiunit structure includes a plurality of light-emitting layers connected in series while electric conductive layers (referred to as interlayers) are interposed therebetween, the multiunit makes it possible to realize high luminance, high efficiency, and a long life while securing the merit of a thin light source for which organic electroluminescent elements are known. High efficiency and long life can be achieved by reducing a current density that is required to obtain the same luminance.', 'However, in an element with the multiunit structure, it has been difficult to improve a light outcoupling property by the optical design described in the above Patent Documents.', 'In the method described in Patent Document 1, the component amount of light that is emitted outside in the frontal direction from the substrate is designed to be maximized. Since the multiunit structure that is advantageous in terms of high luminance and a long life as described above provides a plurality of light emitting positions and a plurality of emission wavelengths, it has been very difficult to have a preferable film thickness condition that satisfies the relations.', 'The method described in Patent Document 2 is expected to have an effect of providing high efficiency of luminance compared with the method in Patent Document 1. However, since the structure in Patent Document 2 is focused on light of a specific wavelength or in a specific direction, it is not necessarily the preferred design for increasing light flux at a plurality of wavelengths that is emitted in all directions. Moreover, in a case where the light-emitting layer emits light that has a plurality of light colors and a broad spectrum, an adverse effect of chromaticity shift due to a viewing angle difference becomes extremely great, and a problem of viewing angle dependence occurs in which colors differ depending on the viewing angle and the visual quality deteriorates.', 'Patent Document 3 discloses a method in which the viewing angle dependence is reduced by implementing a structure that has a plurality of resonant distances in one element. However, in the method in Patent Document 3, although the structure is devised taking the chromaticity shift into consideration, since layers with different thicknesses are included in one element, the manufacturing process becomes complicated. Also, application to a structure that has a plurality of emission colors such as the multiunit structure is difficult.', 'In terms of an organic electroluminescent element with the multiunit structure, Patent Document 4 discloses that a thin film metal is used as the interlayer of the light-emitting unit in order to increase luminance of the element. However, regarding thin film metal, it is only disclosed that higher transmissivity of the thin film metal is desirable, that is, a thinner thin film metal or no thin film layer is preferable. A design to improve luminance by the microcavity has thus not been achieved. Therefore, it is difficult to further improve the light outcoupling efficiency by the technique described in Patent Document 4.', 'The present invention has been made in view of the above-described problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide an organic electroluminescent element with a multiunit structure having improved light outcoupling efficiency.', 'An organic electroluminescent element according to the present invention has a structure in which a plurality of light-emitting layers are stacked between a first electrode with light reflectivity and a second electrode with optical transparency while one or more interlayers with a light transmissive property are interposed between the plurality of light-emitting layers. The one or more interlayers include a first interlayer closest to the first electrode. A first light-emitting unit is formed between the first electrode and the first interlayer to include a first light-emitting layer that is one of the plurality of light-emitting layers and has a first light-emitting source. A second light-emitting unit is formed on a side of the first interlayer close to the second electrode to include a second light-emitting layer which is one of the plurality of light-emitting layers and has a second light-emitting source. The first interlayer is a semi-transmissive layer which has both of optical transparency and light reflectivity and has a total light absorption ratio of 10% or less.', 'In a preferable aspect of the organic electroluminescent element, the semi-transmissive layer has a total light reflectance of 10% or more but less than 50%.', 'In a preferable aspect of the organic electroluminescent element, the semi-transmissive layer contains Ag or an alloy of Ag as a main component.', 'In a preferable aspect of the organic electroluminescent element, the organic electroluminescent element has a characteristic which satisfies relations of:",0

"In order to fulfill the object, a method for manufacturing an electrode for fuel cell according to the present invention, at least includes: performing heat treatment of a support made of mesoporous carbon having a crystallite diameter Lc at 002 plane that is 1.5 nm or less, at 1,700° C. or more and less than 2,300° C.; supporting catalyst particles at least inside of the support subjected to the heat treatment; and applying ionomer to the support supporting the catalyst particles for coating.', 'According to the present invention, the support used includes mesoporous carbon having the crystallite diameter Lc at 002 plane that is 1.5 nm or less, whereby pores (meso-pores) of mesoporous carbon do not collapse by heat treatment even at 1,700° C. or more and less than 2,300° C., and so the durability of mesoporous carbon can be increased. That is, such heat treatment makes the half width of G band of mesoporous carbon making up the support 70 cm−1 or less, and so can increase the crystallization of the support sufficiently. Further catalyst particles are supported at least inside (in the meso-pores) of the support subjected to heat treatment, and so molecules of the ionomer applied to the support supporting catalyst particles for coating hardly enter into the pores (in the meso-pores) of the mesoporous carbon, so that this can suppress contact of ionomer inside of the support with the catalyst particles.', 'If the crystallite diameter Lc at 002 plane exceeds 1.5 nm, pores of mesoporous carbon will collapse during the heat treatment as stated above, and so catalyst particles cannot be supported at least inside (in the meso-pores) of the support subjected to heat treatment in some cases. As a result, when the support supporting catalyst particles is coated with ionomer, the coverage by ionomer of the catalyst particles increases, and so the catalyst particles get poisoning by the ionomer more. If the heat treatment is performed at a temperature less than 1,700° C., half width of G band of the mesoporous carbon making up the support exceeds 70 cm−1 in some cases, which means that crystallization of the support is not enough and so the durability may deteriorate. If the heat treatment is performed at a temperature of 2,300° C. or more, enough pores of the mesoporous carbon cannot be obtained during the heat treatment in some cases.', 'In another preferable embodiment, the heat treatment is performed so that meso-pores having a size of 2 to 10 nm in the support has a specific surface area of meso-pores that is 400 m2/g or more. Such heat treatment allows the half width of G band of mesoporous carbon making up the support to be 70 cm−1 or less and facilitates to support catalyst particles at least inside (in the meso-pores) of the support.', 'If the specific surface area of meso-pores having a size of 2 to 10 nm in the support is less than 400 m2/g, the support subjected to heat treatment may fail to support catalyst particles at least inside thereof (in the meso-pores) in some cases. Further, the ionomer can be applied for coating so that the coverage by ionomer of the total surface area of the entire catalyst particles supported on the support is 72% or less. This can suppress poisoning of catalyst particles by ionomer while improving the specific activity of the electrode for fuel cell obtained.', 'In another preferable embodiment, the method for manufacturing an electrode for fuel cell further includes, after supporting the catalyst particles and before applying the ionomer for coating, performing oxidation treatment of at least a surface of meso-pores of mesoporous carbon of the support.', 'According to this embodiment, oxidation treatment is performed to at least the surface of meso-pores of the mesoporous carbon of the support supporting catalyst particles, whereby oxygen is given to this surface to have hydrophilic nature. This makes the surface of meso-pores adsorb water more, and protons (H+) flowing from ionomer easily reach the catalyst particles in the support. As a result, deterioration of power-generation performance of the fuel cell can be suppressed.', 'In still another preferable embodiment, the oxidation treatment is performed so that oxygen content per unit area contained in a surface of supported catalyst where the catalyst particles are supported on the support is 0.08 mg/m2 or more. The experiment by the present inventors described later shows that the oxygen content satisfying the range as stated above can suppress decrease of power-generation performance of the fuel cell under low humidified environment. It cannot be said that, if the oxygen content is less than 0.08 mg/m2, the hydrophilic nature obtained is sufficient on the surface of meso-pores, and so it may be difficult for protons from ionomer to reach catalyst particles under the low humidified environment in some cases.', 'In a further preferable embodiment, when the supported catalyst subjected to the oxidation treatment is placed under vacuum environment, and when water vapor partial pressure is increased to a vicinity of a saturated water vapor pressure so as to let water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst, and when water vapor partial pressure is decreased from a vicinity of the saturated water vapor pressure while letting water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst so as to let water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst desorb, let that T1 denotes mass of water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst when the water vapor partial pressure is increased to be 60% of the saturated water vapor pressure and T2 denotes mass of water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst when the water vapor partial pressure is decreased to be 60% of the saturated water vapor pressure, the oxidation treatment is performed to the supported catalyst so that a relationship of T1/T2≥0.15 is satisfied.', 'According to this embodiment, as the water vapor partial pressure is increased to the vicinity of the saturated water vapor pressure, the amount of water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst increases, and as the water vapor partial pressure is decreased from the vicinity of the saturated water vapor pressure in this state, water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst desorbs. At this time, the mass T1 of water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst when the water vapor partial pressure is increased to be 60% of the saturated water vapor pressure and the mass T2 of water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst when the water vapor partial pressure is decreased to be 60% of the saturated water vapor pressure are different values even at the same water vapor partial pressure. That is, once water vapor (water) enters into meso-pores and is adsorbed to the surface of meso-pores, such water vapor is difficult to leave from the meso-pores, so that T1', 'In this embodiment, the surface of meso-pores is oxidized so that T1/T2≥0.15, whereby the size of meso-pores is enlarged and drainage performance of water adsorbed to the meso-pores is increased. This allows water inside of the meso-pores to be drained easily even under excessively humidified atmosphere, so that oxygen gas becomes easily diffused from the inside of meso-pores toward the catalyst particles. As a result, deterioration of power-generation performance of the fuel cell can be suppressed even under excessively humidified atmosphere.', 'In a preferable embodiment, in the oxidation treatment, nitric acid aqueous solution that is 0.1 mol/L or more and is heated to be 60° C. or higher is brought into contact with at least the surface of the meso-pores of the mesoporous carbon for 1 hour or more. As is obvious also from the experiment by present inventors described later, this can suppress deterioration of power-generation performance of the fuel cell under low humidified environment and excessively humidified atmosphere for the same reason as stated above.', 'The present application discloses an electrode for fuel cell as well, as the invention. An electrode for fuel cell according to the present invention includes: a support made of mesoporous carbon; catalyst particles supported at least inside of the support; and ionomer with which the support is coated. The mesoporous carbon making up the support has half width of G band that is 70 cm−1 or less.', 'According to the present invention, since the mesoporous carbon has half width of G band that is 70 cm−1 or less, the mesoporous carbon can have increased durability. On the other hand, if the half width of G band of the mesoporous carbon making up the support exceeds 70 cm−1, crystallization of the support is not enough and so the durability may deteriorate.', 'In a preferable embodiment, coverage by the ionomer of a total surface area of the entire catalyst particles supported on the support is more than 0% and 72% or less. This embodiment can suppress poisoning of catalyst particles by ionomer while improving the specific activity of the electrode for fuel cell obtained.', 'In another preferable embodiment, before applying the ionomer to the support for coating, oxygen content per unit area contained in a surface of supported catalyst where the catalyst particles are supported on the support is 0.08 mg/m2 or more.', 'According to this embodiment, since the oxygen content satisfies the range as stated above, decrease of power-generation performance of the fuel cell can be suppressed under low humidified environment. If the oxygen content is less than 0.08 mg/m2, the hydrophilic nature obtained is sufficient on the surface of meso-pores, and so it may be difficult for protons from ionomer to reach catalyst particles under the low humidified environment in some cases.', 'In still another preferable embodiment, when the supported catalyst before applying the ionomer to the support for coating is placed under vacuum environment, and when water vapor partial pressure is increased to a vicinity of a saturated water vapor pressure so as to let water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst, and when water vapor partial pressure is decreased from a vicinity of the saturated water vapor pressure while letting water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst so as to let water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst desorb, let that T1 denotes mass of water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst when the water vapor partial pressure is increased to be 60% of the saturated water vapor pressure and T2 denotes mass of water vapor adsorbed to the supported catalyst when the water vapor partial pressure is decreased to be 60% of the saturated water vapor pressure, the supported catalyst satisfies a relationship of T1/T2≥0.15.', 'According to this embodiment, since the relationship of T1/T2≥0.15 is satisfied, drainage performance of water (water vapor) adsorbed to the meso-pores is increased. This allows water inside of the meso-pores to be drained easily even under excessively humidified atmosphere, so that oxygen gas becomes easily diffused from the inside of meso-pores toward the catalyst particles. As a result, deterioration of power-generation performance of the fuel cell can be suppressed even under excessively humidified atmosphere.",0

"According to an aspect of the present invention, a hollow fiber degassing module includes a cylinder, a first lid that seals one end of the cylinder and that has a liquid supply port, a second lid that seals the other end of the cylinder, a liquid inflow portion that includes a cylindrical main body and multiple openings formed in the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical main body, the cylindrical main body being in communication with the liquid supply port inside the cylinder and extending in the axial direction of the cylinder, a hollow fiber membrane bundle that is provided inside the cylinder so as to cover the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical main body and that includes multiple hollow fiber membranes, a liquid outlet that discharges the liquid inside the cylinder, a first air outlet that is provided to any one of the first lid and the second lid and connected to the inside of the multiple hollow fiber membranes, and a bubble outlet that is provided to the cylinder and that discharges a bubble in the liquid.', 'In such a hollow fiber degassing module, the liquid supplied to the cylindrical main body of the liquid inflow portion through the liquid supply port enters the cylinder via the openings. A dissolved gas and fine bubble contained in the liquid inside the cylinder enters the inside of the hollow fiber membranes. In particular, the liquid that has entered the cylinder is degassed when it passes through the hollow fiber membrane bundle. A gas or another matter that has entered the inside of the hollow fiber membranes is discharged from the first air outlet to the outside of the hollow fiber degassing module. A bubble existing in the liquid inside the cylinder and not removed by the hollow fiber membranes is discharged from the bubble outlet, which is different from the liquid outlet, to the outside of the hollow fiber degassing module. Hence, use of the hollow fiber degassing module enables the liquid to be well degassed and defoamed.', 'The bubble outlet may be positioned above the liquid outlet. In this case, the amount of the liquid to be discharged from the bubble outlet can be reduced, and the length of the flow channel of the liquid to the liquid outlet inside the cylinder is increased. This structure can well restrain bubbles from existing in the liquid that is to be discharged from the liquid outlet.', 'The bubble outlet may be positioned above the multiple openings. This structure enables a reduction in the backflow of bubbles in the liquid via the openings.', 'The hollow fiber degassing module may further include a second air outlet that is provided to the other one of the first lid and the second lid and connected to the inside of the multiple hollow fiber membranes.

In this case, the first and second sealing portions separate the space being in connection with the first air outlet from the first space being in connection with each of the multiple openings, the liquid outlet, and the bubble outlet. This structure can well restrain a gas that is to be discharged to the first air outlet from entering the first space.', 'The first sealing portion may be positioned above the second sealing portion in the axial direction, and the bubble outlet may be spaced apart from the first sealing portion in the axial direction. In this case, a region in which bubbles gather is formed between the first sealing portion and the bubble outlet inside the cylinder in the axial direction. A gas derived from the bubbles gathering in such a region enters the inside of the hollow fiber membranes exposed to this region, thereby being able to be well removed.', 'The first lid may be positioned above the second lid in the axial direction. In this case, the liquid supply port can supply the liquid to the cylindrical main body by gravity fall.', 'The liquid outlet may be provided to the cylinder. In this case, the degassed liquid can be well discharged regardless of the shapes of the first lid and second lid.', 'The liquid may have a viscosity of 1000 mPa·s or more. At this viscosity, a bubble in the liquid is hard to be broken, and use of only the hollow fiber membrane bundle tends to result in insufficient defoaming. The hollow fiber degassing module has the bubble outlet. Hence, even when a liquid to be processed by the hollow fiber degassing module has a viscosity of 1000 mPa·s or more, the liquid can be well degassed and defoamed.', 'A method for degassing a liquid with the hollow fiber degassing module includes degassing a liquid with a bubble in the liquid being discharged from the bubble outlet of the hollow fiber degassing module.

"Various studies have been made to achieve the above objects and the following facts have been discovered: when CNTs with a certain specific surface area is prepared into a coarse dispersion liquid and are subjected to a shear force while being subjected to a back pressure and/or cooled to reduce formation of air bubbles, the CNTs can be uniformly and efficiently dispersed without dispersion effects by cavitation (i.e., formation and burst of air bubbles). In a dispersion liquid obtained as such, CNTs are less damaged. Based on the discoveries, the methods and products to be disclosed herein have been reached.', 'To advantageously solve the above-mentioned problem, the method for producing a carbon nanotube dispersion liquid according to the disclosure includes: (A) obtaining a carbon nanotube dispersion liquid by applying a shear force to a coarse dispersion liquid that includes carbon nanotubes having a specific surface area of 600 m2/g or more to whereby disperse the carbon nanotubes, wherein the step (A) includes at least one of applying a back pressure to the carbon nanotube dispersion liquid and cooling the carbon nanotube dispersion liquid. The application of back pressure and/or cooling upon application of a shear force to the coarse dispersion liquid to disperse the carbon nanotubes allows for reduction in formation of air bubbles in the dispersion liquid. This further suppresses adhesion of air bubbles to the CNTs and energy loss due to the formation of air bubbles, thereby allowing CNTs with a large specific surface area to be dispersed uniformly and efficiently. The dispersibility obtained by the suppressed adhesion of air bubbles to the CNTs will be improved particularly well when CNTs with a specific surface area of 600 m2/g or more are dispersed. The reduction in formation of air bubbles in the dispersion liquid can also prevent CNTs from being damaged by cavitation.', '“Specific surface area” as used herein refers to a nitrogen absorption specific surface area measured by a BET method (“BET specific surface area”).', 'The method for producing a carbon nanotube dispersion liquid preferably further includes: (B) reducing multi-stepwise the back pressure applied to the carbon nanotube dispersion liquid obtained by the step (A). The multi-stepwise back-pressure reduction in the CNT dispersion liquid, performed when back pressure is applied in the step (A), can reduce the formation of air bubbles in the dispersion liquid caused by pressure drop that occurs as the CNT dispersion liquid with a back pressure was released into atmospheric pressure. The reduction in air bubbles can prevent the CNTs from being damaged so that the CNTs can be dispersed uniformly and efficiently.', 'The above CNT dispersion liquid obtained by the method for producing a carbon nanotube dispersion liquid may be mixed together with a polymer material-containing liquid, such as latex, to be used for producing a composite material composition.', 'Such a composite material composition obtained as above may be used for producing a composite material.', 'The above composite material composition may be formed into the composite material by solidification, and the composite material may be shaped into a composite-material shaped product.

"The noise suppression structure using the circuits shown in FIGS. 14 and 15 needs inductors and capacitors to be mounted on the circuit substrate 1. For this reason, it is necessary to arrange an area for mounting circuit components on the circuit substrate 101, thus expanding the scale of the circuit substrate 101. Additionally, it is necessary to shoulder the cost for managing circuit components in addition to the cost of circuit components; this may increase working routines and lead times for mounting circuit components on the circuit substrate 101. Moreover, it is necessary to allocate filters to individual lines in the structure in which filters are inserted into signal lines, thus increasing design steps. Certain types of electronic devices may need to mount several tens to several hundreds of capacitors and inductors on a single circuit substrate, thus increasing the area for mounting circuit components, the cost thereof, and the design/manufacture time thereof.', 'The noise suppression structure disclosed in Patent Literature 1 has a multilayered structure in which a single noise suppression layer is electromagnetically coupled with first and second conductors through an insulating layer.

"In sealed letter formation, when printing to enclosing and sealing are automatically performed, with the combination of an envelope sheet and single or plural sheet-type content sheets as a content as an “article (of mail)”, the envelope sheet and the content sheet are processed in the same order by article, and a predetermined number of articles are continuously processed (this will be referred to as a “Job”). That is, the “article” is a combination of envelope and content sheet, and the “Job” is a set of articles as a unit at execution of continuous sealed letter forming processing.', 'In the enclosing and sealing machine connected to a printer as disclosed in the above-described Patent Literature 2, the printer sends an envelope sheet and a content sheet into the enclosing and sealing machine in the order of articles. For example, when one article has an envelope and two content sheets, as the order of sheets sent from the printer, the first content sheet of the first article, then the second content sheet of the first article, then the envelope of the first article, the first content sheet of the second article, then the second content sheet of the second article, and the envelope of the second article (by the predetermined number set as a Job) are sent. In this order, there is no shift in the combinations between the envelopes and the content sheets.', 'However, upon occurrence of error such as paper jam, it is necessary to again perform printing on the article including the error-occurred sheet (envelope sheet or content sheet). This increases the possibility of shift in the combinations of envelope sheets and content sheets. Particularly, in an envelope without a window, it is difficult to check whether or not the combination is correct without opening the envelope to see the content. For example, in a sealed letter of an article, when there is a shift in the combination between an addressee and the content printed on the content sheet, shifts occur in the subsequent combinations between the envelope sheets and the content sheets. Accordingly, to prevent erroneous dispatch of erroneously-combined sealed letters, it is important to check the content of a sealed letter in an error-occurred article.', 'Note that when a print sheet sequentially supplied from the printer has not been detected with a sensor within a predetermined period calculated from the length of conveyance passage and conveyance speed, it is determined that a paper-jam error has occurred. The sheet detection sensor is provided in plural positions on the conveyance passage. Further, since the conveyance passage is sufficiently longer than the sheet length (the length in the conveyance direction), during printing, plural sheets exist in the machine. Accordingly, all the sheets upstream of a paper-jam error detection position are disposed, while at least one article having a correct set of sheets downstream of the paper-jam error detection position is subjected to normal printing, enclosing and sealing, and discharged as a sealed letter. An article in which sheets are not correctly set is disposed.', 'Further, the enclosing and sealing machine as disclosed in the above-described Patent Literature 2 lacks means for checking the combination of envelope sheet and content sheet(s) in an article following the error. It is troublesome to open an envelope to check the content upon each occurrence of error, accordingly, printing is often restarted, not from the error-occurred article, but from the beginning of the Job. However, this print restart increases the costs of the sheets. Especially the envelope sheet is expensive. It is desirable to avoid such wasteful disposal.', 'The present invention has been made in view of the above situation, and has an object to provide a sealed letter forming apparatus in which, when an error occurs in an article and the error is canceled, the sealed letter of the error-occurred article is made easily recognizable as a “sealed letter to be checked”, and the content of the sealed letter to be checked is made easily checkable, so as to prevent erroneous dispatch and reduce the costs of the sheets.",2

"According to the swing nozzle related to the first aspect of the invention, for example, in a state where the frame is inclined to one side with respect to the base, the flexible section of the pipe body bends, whereby a state is created where the opening portion side of the pipe body is inclined further to one side than the frame. In this state, a fluid is discharged from the opening portion of the pipe body, a reactive force directed to the other side is generated on the opening portion side of the pipe body, and the reactive force is transmitted from the support body supporting the pipe body to the frame, and thus the pipe body and the frame swing around the base toward the other side against the biasing force of the flexible section. Then, on the way, the bend state of the flexible section of the pipe body is reversed at a predetermined angle around the base, a state is created where the frame is instantaneously turned to a turning end on the other side with respect to the base by the biasing force of the flexible section, and a state is created where the opening portion side of the pipe body is inclined further to the other side than the frame. Then, a reactive force directed to one side is generated on the opening portion side of the pipe body, and the reactive force makes the pipe body and the frame swing toward one side against the biasing force of the flexible section. In this way, the pipe body oscillates in a reciprocating manner, that is, performs a swing movement. In this manner, since the pipe body is supported by the base which turnably supports the base end side of the frame, the frame, and the support body which is supported on the leading end side of the frame and a swing movement using the reactive force and the biasing force of the pipe body is performed, it is possible to stably perform a swing movement in a plane.', 'Furthermore, it is possible to make the opening portion of the pipe body oscillate in a reciprocating manner at a larger angle than the oscillation angle of the frame. Therefore, it is possible to more extensively discharge a fluid.', 'According to the swing nozzle related to the second aspect of the invention, when the support position of the pipe body is adjusted by the support position adjustment section provided at the support body, the length of the pipe body between the base and the support body, that is, the bend state of the flexible section can be adjusted, and as a result, it is possible to change a swinging angle.",1
"With the quartz crystal blank 17 and the quartz crystal resonator unit 10 according to the present embodiment, the CI value can be reduced. To be more specific, as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5, the quartz crystal blank 17 has a sectional shape such that the thickness thereof decreases with increasing distance from the center of the front surface. Thus, the vibration energy of the main vibration of the quartz crystal blank 17 is confined in the region A1. The excitation electrodes 100 and 101 are disposed on the region A1. As a result, the main vibration is efficiently converted into an electric signal, and the electric signal is output from the excitation electrodes 100 and 101. Thus, with the quartz crystal blank 17 and the quartz crystal resonator unit 10, the CI value can be reduced.', 'With the quartz crystal blank 17 and the quartz crystal resonator unit 10, the CI value can be reduced also for the following reasons. FIG. 8 is a graph representing the relationship between the frequencies of a main vibration and sub-vibrations and W/T of a quartz crystal blank 17 in which the frequency of the main vibration is 36.0 MHz. FIG. 9 is a graph representing the relationship between the frequencies of a main vibration and sub-vibrations and W/T of a quartz crystal blank 17 in which the frequency of the main vibration is 37.4 MHz. FIG. 10 is a graph representing the relationship between the frequencies of a main vibration and sub-vibrations and W/T of a quartz crystal blank 17 in which the frequency of the main vibration is 40.0 MHz. In each of FIGS. 8 to 10, the triangles represent the main vibration, and the squares and the rhombuses represent the sub-vibrations.', 'In the quartz crystal blank 17 and the quartz crystal resonator unit 10, sub-vibrations occur in addition to a main vibration. The main vibration is a thickness shear vibration. The frequency of the main vibration depends on the thickness T of the quartz crystal blank 17. The sub-vibrations, which are vibrations other than the main vibration, occur due to extension and contraction of the quartz crystal blank 17 in the short-side direction, extension and contraction of the quartz crystal blank 17 in the long-side direction, warping of the quartz crystal blank 17, and the like. The frequencies of the sub-vibrations depend on the length L, the width W, and the like. Such sub-vibrations are so-called spurious vibrations. As can be understood from the results of simulation described below, in which W/T was changed while keeping the length L of the quartz crystal blank 17 in the long-side direction constant, sub-vibrations that may occur in the quartz crystal blank 17 and the quartz crystal resonator unit 10 can be suppressed by adjusting W/T.', 'Here, the CI value of the quartz crystal blank 17 and of the quartz crystal resonator unit 10 can be reduced by designing the quartz crystal blank 17 and the quartz crystal resonator 16 so as to separate the frequency of the main vibration from the frequencies of the sub-vibrations. The inventors studied the relationship between W/T and the frequencies of the main vibration and the sub-vibrations by performing computer simulation. In the computer simulation, for three types of quartz crystal blanks 17 having main vibration frequencies of 36.0 MHz, 37.4 MHz, and 40.0 MHz, the width W was changed while keeping the thickness T constant. The simulation conditions are as follows.', '(1) 36.0 MHz', 'thickness T: 0.0464 mm', 'length L: 0.800 mm', 'length RL: 0.533 mm', 'RW/W: 0.64', '(2) 37.4 MHz', 'thickness T: 0.0447 mm', 'length L: 0.800 mm', 'length RL: 0.533 mm', 'RW/W: 0.64', '(3) 40.0 MHz', 'thickness T: 0.0418 mm', 'length L: 0.800 mm', 'length RL: 0.533 mm', 'RW/W: 0.64', 'By performing simulation under the above conditions, the results shown in FIGS. 8 to 10 were obtained. Then, the inventors investigated preferable W/T on the basis of the simulation results.",1
"The present invention has the following configurations as means for solving the above-described problems.', 'An electrostatic chuck device according to an aspect of the present invention includes: an electrostatic chuck part which has a mounting surface on one principal surface thereof to mount a plate-shaped sample and has an electrode for electrostatic attraction; a temperature controlling base part which is provided at a side opposite to the mounting surface of the electrostatic chuck part and is configured to cool the electrostatic chuck part; a high frequency generating electrode which is provided in a layer between the electrostatic chuck part and the temperature controlling base part; a high frequency power source which is connected to the high frequency generating electrode; a first heater element which is configured with a plurality of main heaters which are provided in a layer between the high frequency generating electrode and the temperature controlling base part; and a guard electrode which is provided in a layer between the high frequency generating electrode and the first heater element.', 'According to this configuration, the guard electrode cuts off high frequencies which are generated from the high frequency generating electrode. For this reason, it is possible to suppress the influence of the high frequency on a heater power source configuring the first heater element. Further, it is possible to remove a high frequency cut-off filter for the first heater element. That is, complication of the configuration of the electrostatic chuck device is avoided, and this contributes to a reduction in the manufacturing cost of the electrostatic chuck device.', 'In the electrostatic chuck device according to an aspect of the present invention, a configuration can be adopted in which the electrostatic chuck device further includes a second heater element which are configured with a plurality of sub-heaters disposed in a layer between the first heater element and the guard electrode or between the first heater element and the temperature controlling base part.', 'According to this configuration, in addition to the guard electrode, the first heater element or the second heater element which is disposed on the guard electrode side also cuts off high frequencies which are generated from the high frequency generating electrode. Therefore, it is possible to further suppress the influence of the high frequency on the first heater element or the second heater element which is disposed on the temperature controlling base part side. That is, it is possible to further reduce a concern that the high frequency may leak as noise to a heater power source of the heater and impair the operation or performance of the heater power source.', 'Further, according to this configuration, the temperature distribution of each zone divided into a plurality of main heaters can be individually controlled and the temperature control in each zone can be finely adjusted by the sub-heater. For this reason, even if a partial temperature distribution occurs in the plate-shaped sample due to variation in plasma generation state or film forming condition while holding the plate-shaped sample, it is possible to suppress the temperature distribution by the fine adjustment of a temperature by the sub-heater. Therefore, in a case of being applied to an etching apparatus or a film forming apparatus, this contributes to improvement in uniformity of an etching rate and contributes to control of a local etching rate and improvement in stability of film formation.', 'In the electrostatic chuck device according to an aspect of the present invention, a configuration can be adopted in which the guard electrode has a first heat transfer barrier extending in a circumferential direction thereof.', 'According to this configuration, it is possible to suppress the conduction of heat in an in-plane direction through the guard electrode and further enhance the temperature controllability for each region. In the electrostatic chuck device, heat conduction in a concentric circular direction (a circumferential direction) in the in-plane direction can be permitted. On the other hand, heat conduction in a radial direction can become a factor of impairing temperature uniformity. For this reason, the temperature controllability of the electrostatic chuck device can be further enhanced by thermally separating the guard electrode in the radial direction.', 'In the electrostatic chuck device according to an aspect of the present invention, a configuration can be adopted in which the plurality of main heaters, which form the first heater element, are disposed concentrically in an annular shape in a circular region, and the first heat transfer barrier is provided to planarly overlap a region wherein the region is provided between the plurality of main heaters which are adjacent to each other in a radial direction in the circular region.', 'According to this configuration, it is possible to inhibit heat transfer in the in-plane direction of the metal plate in accordance with a region in which a temperature is controlled by each main heater and sub-heater. That is, it is possible to further enhance the temperature controllability for each region of the electrostatic chuck device 1.', 'In the electrostatic chuck device according to an aspect of the present invention, a configuration can be adopted in which the plurality of main heaters, which form the first heater element, are disposed concentrically in a circular region, the high frequency generating electrode has a second heat transfer barrier which extends in a circumferential direction thereof, and the second heat transfer barrier is provided to planarly overlap a region wherein the region is provided between the plurality of main heaters which are adjacent to each other in a radial direction in a circular region.', 'According to this configuration, it is possible to suppress the conduction of heat in the in-plane direction through the high frequency generating electrode and further enhance the temperature controllability for each region. The temperature controllability of the electrostatic chuck device can be further enhanced by thermally separating the high frequency generating electrode in the radial direction. Further, the potential in the electrode can be kept electrically uniform, and therefore, it is possible to reduce the influence on plasma density.', 'A configuration can be adopted in which a material which forms the high frequency generating electrode in the electrostatic chuck device according to an aspect of the present invention is a non-magnetic metal material.', 'The material for formation of the high frequency generating electrode is formed of non-magnetic metal, whereby even if the electrostatic chuck device is used in a high frequency atmosphere, self-heating of the high frequency generating electrode due to a high frequency does not occur.

"The inventors have found through intensive studies that, among polycrystalline silicon carbide materials with a 3C crystal polymorph, there are materials likely to be eluted into a silicon melt layer and materials less likely to be eluted into a silicon melt layer and that the materials less likely to be eluted into a silicon melt layer can be suitably used as the seed material for liquid phase epitaxial growth of a monocrystalline silicon carbide. As a result, the inventors have led to the accomplishment of the invention.', 'Specifically, a seed material for liquid phase epitaxial growth of a monocrystalline silicon carbide according to the present invention is a seed material used in a method for liquid phase epitaxial growth of a monocrystalline silicon carbide. The seed material for liquid phase epitaxial growth of a monocrystalline silicon carbide according to the present invention includes a surface layer containing a polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph. Upon Raman spectroscopic analysis of the surface layer with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm, a peak other than a TO peak and an LO peak is observed as a peak derived from the polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph. The peak other than the TO peak and the LO peak is preferably observed at a lower wavenumber than that of the TO peak.', 'In the present invention, the seed material is such that upon Raman spectroscopic analysis of the surface layer thereof with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm, a peak other than a TO peak and an LO peak is observed as a peak derived from a polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph. Therefore, the surface layer of the seed material for liquid phase epitaxial growth of a monocrystalline silicon carbide according to the present invention is less likely to cause elution into a silicon melt layer. Thus, with the use of the seed material for liquid phase epitaxial growth of a monocrystalline silicon carbide according to the present invention, a concentration gradient in the silicon melt layer can be suitably formed, so that liquid phase epitaxial growth of silicon carbide can be suitably performed.', 'Furthermore, the surface layer of the seed material for liquid phase epitaxial growth of a monocrystalline silicon carbide according to the present invention contains a polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph. Therefore, unlike the case where the surface layer contains a polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 4H or 6H crystal polymorph and the case where the surface layer is made of a monocrystalline silicon carbide, the surface layer can be formed with ease at low cost by CVD (chemical vapor deposition).', 'Hence, with the use of the seed material for liquid phase epitaxial growth of a monocrystalline silicon carbide according to the present invention, an epitaxial growth film of a monocrystalline silicon carbide can be formed with ease at low cost.', 'Furthermore, in the present invention, since a peak other than a TO peak and an LO peak is observed as a peak derived from a polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph upon Raman spectroscopic analysis of the surface layer of the seed material with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm, a hexagonal monocrystalline silicon carbide epitaxial growth film can be suitably formed.', 'In this relation, the peak derived from a polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph and other than a TO peak and an LO peak can be considered as a peak derived from structural defects of 3C (the cubic crystal). Therefore, if a peak other than a TO peak and an LO peak is observed as a peak derived from a polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph, the 3C crystal structure can be considered to have structural defects.', 'For example, if the 3C crystal structure has no structural defect, it can be considered that when a monocrystalline silicon carbide is epitaxially grown on the surface layer of the seed material, the crystal structure of the surface layer of the seed material is highly likely to be introduced into the monocrystalline silicon carbide, which makes it likely that a monocrystalline silicon carbide epitaxial growth film with a 3C crystal structure is formed.', 'In contrast, if the 3C crystal structure has structural defects, it can be considered that the seed material generates a portion of the surface layer having a crystal structure similar to a hexagonal crystal and the portion nucleates epitaxial growth, so that a monocrystalline silicon carbide epitaxial growth film with a hexagonal crystal structure is suitably formed.', 'In view of this, the higher the peak intensity of the peak derived from a polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph and other than a TO peak and an LO peak, the better. Specifically, the peak derived from a polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph and other than a TO peak and an LO peak preferably has a peak intensity 0.3 or greater times the peak intensity of the TO peak.', 'The term “method for liquid phase epitaxial growth” in the present invention refers to a method in which the seed material and a feed material are heated in a position facing each other with a silicon melt layer therebetween to form a concentration gradient of graphite melting in the silicon melt layer and a monocrystalline silicon carbide is epitaxially grown on the seed material using the concentration gradient.', 'The term “LO peak derived from a polycrystalline silicon carbide” in the present invention refers to a peak which is derived from the longitudinal optical mode among optical modes of oscillation between the two atoms of Si—C in the silicon carbide crystal and generally, in the case of a 3C polymorph, appears at 972 cm−1.', 'On the other hand, the term “TO peak derived from a polycrystalline silicon carbide” refers to a peak which is derived from the transverse optical mode among optical modes of oscillation between the two atoms of Si—C in the silicon carbide crystal and generally, in the case of a 3C polymorph, appears at 796 cm−1.', 'The term “feed material” in the present invention refers to a material capable of feeding ingredients for epitaxial growth of a monocrystalline silicon carbide, such for example as Si, C, and SiC. On the other hand, the term “seed material” refers to a material on the surface of which a monocrystalline silicon carbide can grow.', 'In the present invention, preferably, the absolute amount of shift of the LO peak from 972 cm−1 is 4 cm−1 or more, and more preferably, the amount of shift of the LO peak from 972 cm−1 is 4 cm−1 or more. In this case, the rate of epitaxial growth of the monocrystalline silicon carbide can be further increased. The reason for this can be that when the absolute amount of shift of the LO peak from 972 cm−1 is 4 cm−1 or more, the internal stress of the surface layer of the seed material is increased to increase the denseness of the surface layer, which makes the surface layer less likely to cause the elution into the silicon melt layer.', 'In the present invention, the full width at half-maximum of the LO peak is preferably 15 cm−1 or less. With the use of the seed material having this structure, the rate of epitaxial growth of the monocrystalline silicon carbide can be still further increased.', 'The reason why the rate of epitaxial growth of the monocrystalline silicon carbide can be further increased when the full width at half-maximum of the LO peak is 15 cm−1 or less can be that smaller full widths at half-maximum of the LO peak can be caused by higher degrees of crystallinity or lower impurity concentrations of the polycrystalline silicon carbide in the surface layer, which makes it still less likely to cause the elution from the surface layer.', 'In the present invention, the surface layer preferably contains a polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph as a major ingredient and is preferably substantially made of the polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph. With this structure, the rate of epitaxial growth of the monocrystalline silicon carbide can be still more effectively increased.', 'The term “major ingredient” in the present invention refers to an ingredient which is contained in a proportion of 50% by mass or more in the surface layer.', 'The expression “substantially made of the polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph” means that the surface layer contains no ingredient other than the polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph, except for impurities. The content of impurities in the surface layer when “substantially made of the polycrystalline silicon carbide with a 3C crystal polymorph” is generally 5% by mass or less.",0

"According to the one embodiment of the present invention, in the respective channels of the NMOS transistor, the values of parasitic resistance of the source wiring and the drain wiring with respect to the respective channels differ from one another, but the values of the total resistance of the parasitic resistance of the source wiring and the parasitic resistance of the drain wiring are substantially equal to one another. Then, the surge current is likely to flow uniformly among the channels. In other words, the surge current is less likely to concentrate on a particular channel. Consequently, in the NMOS transistor for an ESD protection circuit, breakdown due to local heat generation is less likely to occur, resulting in high ESD tolerance.",1

"In a display device provided with an optical sensor portion, in addition to a TFD used in the optical sensor portion, a TFT for pixel switching and a TFT for a driving circuit are sometimes formed on one and the same substrate. Especially, in a display device having a touch panel function or a scanner function, or in a display device having both of the functions, two types of TFDs in which the detectable light wavelength regions are different are sometimes formed on one and the same substrate. For example, if a TFD for detecting visible light, a TFD for detecting infrared rays from a backlight, and a TFT are formed on one and the same substrate, the sensing of an object or an image which is in contact with the screen can be performed by utilizing not only the ambient light (visible light) incident on the display panel, but also the infrared rays emitted from the backlight. In such a display device, if a plurality of kinds of TFDs and TFTs are to be simultaneously formed on the substrate, it is difficult to individually optimize the device properties required for the TFDs and the TFTs.', 'The above-mentioned problem will be specifically described by way of an example of a touch panel type display device provided with a visible light sensor for detecting visible light, and an infrared-ray sensor for detecting infrared rays. In the display device, a TFD used for the visible light sensor (a first TFD) and a TFD used for the infrared-ray sensor (a second TFD) are formed on one and the same substrate. At this time, if the structure suggested in Patent Document 4 is applied to the first TFD, a reflecting structure including a reflecting film and an insulating film which are the same as the first TFD is formed below the semiconductor layers of the second TFD and the TFT. As a result, sufficient infrared rays are not incident on the second TFD, thereby degrading the sensitivity of the infrared-ray sensor, or the visible light is incident on the semiconductor layer of the TFT, so that there is some possibility that an off-current of the TFT may be increased.', 'A conventional display device does not specifically take effective countermeasures for increasing the sensitivity to infrared rays. Such countermeasures as that the sensitivity of infrared-ray sensor is increased by increasing the intensity of illumination of a backlight which emits light including infrared rays (referred to as an “IR backlight”) are carried out, but they may result in the increase in power consumption of backlight.', 'The present invention has been conducted in view of the above-described problems, and the objective of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device including a first thin film diode for detecting light in a first wavelength region and a second thin film diode for detecting light in a second wavelength region on one and the same substrate in which the sensitivity of a sensor including the first thin film diode with respect to the light in the first wavelength region and the sensitivity of a sensor including the second thin film diode with respect to the light in the second wavelength region are both obtained sufficiently.",2

"Although the electrode material used as the lower electrode or the upper electrode is not particularly described in the nonvolatile storage element of the aforementioned conventional example, there is a particular limitation on the electrodes which causes the resistor to reversibly vary, and the material is limited to particular materials. For example, when the nonvolatile storage element as in the aforementioned conventional example is manufactured by using platinum (Pt) which is representative of generally difficult-to-etch materials, and so on, in the lower electrode and the upper electrode or in either one, variable resistance is facilitated and the characteristics of the nonvolatile storage element become stable. However, since Pt is a difficult-to-etch material, when a conventional photoresist is used as a mask, the photoresist is etched during etching and its dimensions are reduced, the dimensional difference between the upper electrode and the lower electrode becomes big since Pt assumes a tapered shape, the shift in the shape of the resistor becomes big, and thus there is a tendency for the variation in the characteristics of the nonvolatile storage elements to become big.', 'Furthermore, although the shape of Pt after etching, the dimensional difference between the upper electrode and the lower electrode, and the shift in the shape of the resistor tend to improve when a conductive material having a lower etching rate than the photoresist is used as a mask in the etching of Pt, the mask becomes tapered in shape. When an inter-layer contact is connected to the upper electrode-side in such state, the connection becomes unstable since the connection area of the inter-layer contact is not flat, and this becomes a cause of characteristic variation.', 'As such, although the mask needs to be removed, etching for mask removal etches even up to the inter-layer insulating film located at the lower part of the nonvolatile storage element and it is difficult to control the etched-out amount for the inter-layer insulating film, and thus the shape of the nonvolatile storage element varies and the variation in characteristics becomes big.', 'The present invention is conceived in order to solve the aforementioned problem and has as an object to provide: a method for manufacturing a nonvolatile storage device in which the etched-out amount for the inter-layer insulating film is controllable even when a difficult-to-etch material is used in the upper electrode and the lower electrode or in either one, and which has little shape variation; and a method for manufacturing a nonvolatile storage device including such nonvolatile storage element.",2

"According to a first aspect of the present invention provided in order to achieve the above-mentioned object, a manufacturing apparatus for a glass film includes a direction converting device for converting a traveling direction of a glass film ribbon, which is drawn downward vertically from a forming device, from a vertical direction to a horizontal direction by transporting the glass film ribbon toward a downstream side while being curved in a longitudinal direction of the glass film ribbon, the direction converting device including curve-supporting unit for supporting the glass film ribbon in a state of being curved in the longitudinal direction, the curve-supporting unit including two lines of end portion supporting parts for supporting widthwise end regions of the glass film ribbon without supporting a widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon.', 'Note that, the “vertical direction” mentioned in the present invention also includes a direction slightly inclined with respect to the vertical direction, and similarly, the “horizontal direction” also includes a direction slightly inclined with respect to the horizontal direction. Further, the “glass film” mentioned in the present invention includes a sheet glass cut to a predetermined dimension, and a sheet glass rolled into a roll shape (so-called glass roll). The same applies to the other components according to the present invention described below.', 'The glass film ribbon drawn downward vertically from the forming device has a thickness controlled by gripping and pulling the widthwise end regions thereof with rolls or the like, and hence only the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon serves as an available portion of the glass film ribbon. Therefore, as described above, when the curve-supporting unit is constructed of the two lines of end portion supporting parts for supporting the widthwise end regions of the glass film ribbon without supporting the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon, the contact between the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon and the curve-supporting unit is avoided during the transport of the glass film ribbon in the curved state. Accordingly, the small defect is unlikely to be formed in the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon, that is, the available portion, and the outflow of a defective item of the glass film to the subsequent step is suppressed.', 'Further, according to a second aspect of the present invention provided in order to achieve the above-mentioned object, a manufacturing apparatus for a glass film includes a direction converting device for converting a traveling direction of a glass film ribbon, which is drawn downward vertically from a forming device, from a vertical direction to a horizontal direction by transporting the glass film ribbon toward a downstream side while being curved in a longitudinal direction of the glass film ribbon, the direction converting device including curve-supporting unit for supporting the glass film ribbon in a state of being curved in the longitudinal direction, the curve-supporting unit including: two lines of end portion supporting parts for supporting widthwise end regions of the glass film ribbon; and a central supporting part interposed between the two lines of end portion supporting parts so as to be capable of supporting a widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon, the central supporting part being reciprocable between a supporting position, at which the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon is supported, and a retreating position, at which the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon is not supported.', 'In the early stage of the forming of the glass film ribbon, it is difficult to stabilize forming precision because the leading end portion of the glass film ribbon is in a free state, and what is worse, if the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon is not totally supported from the stage in which the forming is started, it takes a longer period of time to stabilize the forming precision, resulting in a decrease in production efficiency and yield. In contrast, if the curve-supporting unit includes the central supporting part interposed between the two lines of end portion supporting parts and reciprocable in the above-mentioned manner, the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon is easily switchable between the supported state and the non-supported state. Therefore, for example, when the central supporting part is situated at the supporting position until the forming precision of the glass film ribbon is stabilized (until a predetermined period of time elapses since the start of the forming) and is situated at the retreating position after the predetermined period of time has elapsed, the small defect is unlikely to be formed in the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon, that is, the available portion, and in addition, it becomes possible to reduce the period of time to stabilize the forming precision of the glass film ribbon, to thereby attain the improvement in production efficiency and yield. Note that, the portion of the glass film ribbon formed in the early stage is not basically put into practical use, and hence there arises no serious problem even if a flaw or a crack is formed therein.', 'Further, according to a third aspect of the present invention provided in order to achieve the above-mentioned object, a manufacturing apparatus for a glass film includes a direction converting device for converting a traveling direction of a glass film ribbon, which is drawn downward vertically from a forming device, from a vertical direction to a horizontal direction by transporting the glass film ribbon toward a downstream side while being curved in a longitudinal direction of the glass film ribbon, the direction converting device including curve-supporting unit for supporting the glass film ribbon in a state of being curved in the longitudinal direction, the curve-supporting unit including: two lines of end portion supporting parts for supporting widthwise end regions of the glass film ribbon; and a central supporting part interposed between the two lines of end portion supporting parts so as to be capable of supporting a widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon in a non-contact manner.', 'Even with the manufacturing apparatus having the above-mentioned structure, the contact between the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon and the curve-supporting unit is avoided during the transport of the glass film ribbon in the curved state. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the small defect from being formed in the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon, that is, the available portion, to the extent possible.', 'Also in this case, the central supporting part may be reciprocable between a supporting position, at which the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon is supported in the non-contact manner, and a retreating position, at which the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon is not supported.', 'As a specific example of means for supporting the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon in a non-contact manner, it is conceived that the central supporting part of the curve-supporting unit includes an air supply passage capable of air blast toward the glass film ribbon therethrough.', 'With this structure, the widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon can be supported in a non-contact manner by an air blast pressure (air space formed between the central supporting part of the curve-supporting unit and the glass film ribbon). In addition, by forming the air space between the central supporting part of the curve-supporting unit and the glass film ribbon, it is possible to absorb, with the air space, a change in stress based on a difference in thickness between the respective portions of the glass film ribbon. Thus, the forming precision of the glass film ribbon and therefore the glass film is improved.', 'In the above-mentioned structure, the two lines of end portion supporting parts of the curve-supporting unit may each include an air supply passage capable of air blast toward the glass film ribbon therethrough.', 'With this structure, the widthwise end regions of the glass film ribbon can be supported in a non-contact manner. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the small defect from being formed in the widthwise end regions of the glass film ribbon along with the contact between the curve-supporting unit (end portion supporting parts) and the glass film ribbon to the extent possible. As a result, adverse influence that may occur due to the small defect formed in the widthwise end regions is unlikely to be imposed on the widthwise central region serving as the available portion.', 'The two lines of end portion supporting parts may be configured to support the widthwise end regions of the glass film ribbon in a contact manner. In this case, the two lines of end portion supporting parts can be configured to be driven at a speed substantially the same as a transport speed of the glass film ribbon toward the downstream side.', 'With this structure, the transport of the glass film ribbon in the curved state proceeds as if the glass film ribbon and the end portion supporting parts were integrated with each other. Accordingly, the glass film ribbon is prevented from slidably moving relative to the end portion supporting parts to the extent possible. As a result, the adverse influence that may occur due to the small defect formed in the widthwise end regions of the glass film ribbon can be prevented from being imposed on the widthwise central region serving as the available portion to the extent possible.', 'The above-mentioned structure is suitably applicable to a case where the formed glass film ribbon has a thickness of 10 μm or more and 300 μm or less in a widthwise central portion (vicinity of the central portion) thereof.', 'If the thickness of the glass film ribbon falls below 10 μm in its widthwise central portion, rigidity (strength) of the glass film ribbon becomes insufficient. Therefore, in this case, distortion of the glass film ribbon due to the weight of the glass film ribbon itself becomes larger, and a probability of occurrence of a crack (small defect) becomes higher due to unexpected contact between the distortion part and the manufacturing apparatus. In contrast, the glass film ribbon formed in the above-mentioned manner tends to have a thickness larger in the widthwise end regions than in the widthwise central region. Therefore, if the thickness in the widthwise central portion exceeds 300 μm, the thickness in the widthwise end regions becomes too large, resulting in a difficulty in curving the glass film ribbon. From the above-mentioned matters, the present invention is suitable for a case where the formed glass film ribbon has a thickness of 10 μm or more and 300 μm or less in the widthwise central portion (vicinity of the central portion) thereof.', 'In the above-mentioned structure, it is desired that the forming device be configured to form the glass film ribbon by an overflow downdraw method.', 'The glass film obtained from the glass film ribbon is used as, for example, a glass substrate for a FPD, and in such an application, work of providing fine elements and wiring on the surface of the glass film is performed in the subsequent step. Therefore, the glass film ribbon needs to have a high smoothness (flatness). In this respect, in the overflow downdraw method, the forming of the glass film ribbon proceeds under a state in which the surface thereof is only held in contact with outside air (atmospheric gas), and hence a higher flatness can be ensured for the glass film ribbon as compared to a forming method such as a slot downdraw method using a nozzle. Note that, the same effect is obtained also by using a forming device for forming the glass film ribbon by a so-called redraw method, in which a temporarily solidified glass base material for fabrication is heated and drawn.', 'According to a fourth aspect of the present invention provided in order to achieve the above-mentioned object, a manufacturing method for a glass film includes a direction converting step of converting a traveling direction of a glass film ribbon, which is drawn downward vertically from a forming device, from a vertical direction to a horizontal direction by transporting the glass film ribbon toward a downstream side while being curved in a longitudinal direction of the glass film ribbon, the direction converting step including: supporting widthwise end regions of the glass film ribbon; and avoiding supporting a widthwise central region of the glass film ribbon.', 'With the manufacturing method described above, it is possible to effectively attain the same action and effect as in the case of employing the above-mentioned manufacturing apparatus for a glass film according to the first aspect of the present invention.",0

"In recent years, there is a demand to not only detect problematic states from images captured by a monitoring camera but also specify causes of such problems. For example, it is preferable that a habitual offender who displays problematic behaviors such as garbage dumping or graffiti can be automatically found from images captured by a monitoring camera.', 'This requires two techniques, namely, a technique of detecting problematic behaviors such as garbage dumping or graffiti and a technique of determining whether or not the problematic behaviors are by the same person. However, it is difficult to specify a person responsible for each problematic behavior, using the technique of detecting problematic behaviors.', 'To capture images of problematic behaviors, a camera with a large depression angle is desirably installed so as not to be obstructed by other persons even in a congested environment. To determine whether or not persons in different images are the same person, on the other hand, it is necessary to capture each human face from the front as much as possible, because of constraints in face recognition between images.

"In the related art, in a hybrid vehicle, although not particularly similar to the series system, since a motor generator having a relatively large torque is necessary in order to obtain a sufficient torque of a drive axis and a transmission/reception amount of an electric power between the power generator and the motor generator increases in a LOW gear ratio range, an electrical loss increases and there is still room for improvement.', 'As a method of solving such a point, as a power transmission mechanism of a quadruple type, there is such a structure that an output axis of an internal combustion engine, a first motor generator, a second motor generator, and a drive axis connected to a drive wheel are connected to each rotational element of the power transmission mechanism (differential gear mechanism) having four rotational elements and a motive power of the internal combustion engine and motive powers of the first motor generator and the second motor generator are synthesized and output to the drive axis. The output axis of the internal combustion engine and the drive axis are arranged to the inside rotational elements on a collinear diagram and the first motor generator on the internal combustion engine side and the second motor generator on the drive axis side are arranged to the outside rotational elements on a collinear diagram, thereby decreasing a ratio of the motive powers which are transmitted by the first and second motor generators in the motive power which is transmitted from the internal combustion engine to the drive axis, miniaturizing the first and second motor generators, and improving a transmission efficiency as a driving apparatus (the Official Gazette of JP-A-2004-15982, the Official Gazette of JPA-2002-281607).', 'As a power transmission mechanism of the quadruple type, there is such a structure that a method similar to that of the foregoing structure is used and, further, the fifth rotational element is added and a brake for stopping a rotation of the fifth rotational element is provided (the Official Gazette of Japanese Patent No. 3578451).', 'In the foregoing power transmission mechanism of the triaxial type disclosed in the Official Gazette of Japanese Patent No. 3050125, by adding a drive force which is required for the vehicle and the electric power which is required to charge a battery, a power to be generated by the internal combustion engine is calculated, and a point where an efficiency is as high as possible is calculated from a combination of a torque serving as such a power and an engine rotational speed and is used as a target engine operation point. The first motor generator is driven and controlled so that the engine operation point becomes the target engine operation point, thereby controlling the engine rotational speed.', 'However, in the case of the power transmission mechanism of the triaxial type, since the torque of the second motor generator does not exert an influence on a torque balance, the torque of the first motor generator is determined only by the engine torque and it is sufficient to obtain the torque of the second motor generator so that a drive force becomes a target value. However, in the case of the quadruple type, the torque of the second motor generator also exerts an influence on the torque balance and exerts an influence on the control of the engine rotational speed. Therefore, there is such an inconvenience that the control method of the foregoing triaxial type cannot be used.', 'In the case of the foregoing power transmission mechanism of the quadruple type disclosed in the Official Gazette of JP-A-2004-15982, the torques of the first motor generator and the second motor generator in the case where the vehicle runs in a state where there is no charge/discharge to/from a battery are calculated from a torque balance equation, the engine rotational speed is feedback controlled, and the engine rotational speed and the drive force are controlled. However, nothing is mentioned about the case where there is a charge/discharge to/from the battery.', 'According to the foregoing cited literature 1, in the hybrid system having the internal combustion engine and a plurality of motor generators, the engine rotational speed is set to be high with regard to the engine operation point, and the control technique of the internal combustion engine is disclosed. However, the control of a plurality of motor generators is obscure and, further, the control of a plurality of motor generators in the case of performing the charge/discharge to/from the battery is obscure. It is also necessary that the internal combustion engine and a plurality of motor generators are mechanically and operationally coupled and a plurality of motor generators are controlled with a good torque balance so as to be mutually associated while maintaining the engine operation point to the target value. Further, in the case of performing the charge/discharge to/from the battery, it is necessary to also balance electric power income and expenses. It is, therefore, necessary to control so as to satisfy both of them and the improvement is demanded.', 'It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a drive control apparatus of a hybrid vehicle having an internal combustion engine and a plurality of motor generators, wherein it is possible to attain control of the plurality of motor generators in the case where there is a charge/discharge to/from a battery in the hybrid vehicle and satisfy both of an assurance of a target drive force and assurance of a target charge/discharge in consideration of an operation point of the internal combustion engine (engine operation point).",2
"The present invention is a method for manufacturing a ceramic-metal layer assembly having: a step of forming scribe lines, forming at least one scribe line respective on a front surface and a back surface of a ceramic base material board along dividing lines for dividing the ceramic base material board into a plurality of ceramic boards; a step of joining, laminating a metal board made of aluminum or aluminum alloy with a thickness dimension of not more than 0.4 mm respective on each of the front surface and the back surface of the ceramic base material board with Al—Si base brazing material therebetween so as to cover at least a part of the dividing lines, and heating with pressurizing in a laminating direction; so that the metal boards are joined respectively on the front surface and the back surface of the ceramic base material board; and a step of etching, forming a plurality of metal layers by etching the metal boards along the dividing lines: thereby manufactured is the ceramic-metal layer assembly in which the plurality of metal layers are joined respectively on the front surface and the back surface of the ceramic base material board.', 'In a conventional case in which the scribe line is formed on only one surface of the ceramic base material board, more Si atoms in the brazing material are dispersed in the metal board joined on the back surface on which the scribe lines are not formed than the Si atoms in the brazing material dispersed in the metal board joined on the front surface on which the scribe lines are formed. Thereby the melting point of the metal board on the back surface side is reduced, so that the braze stain may be generated.', 'On the other hand, in the present invention, by forming the scribe lines on respective the front surface and the back surface of the ceramic base material board, when the metal boards are joined on both the surfaces of the ceramic base material board, it is possible to discharge surpluses of the melted brazing material to the outside of the laminated assembly along the scribe lines on both the surfaces. Accordingly, in comparing to a case in which the scribe lines are formed only on one surface, the difference of the content amount of the Si atoms (a difference of the Si density) dispersed from the brazing material is reduced between the metal boards on both the surfaces of the ceramic base material board: so that the metal boards can be etched at substantially the same etching rate, and it is possible to form the metal layers with substantially the same size.', 'Moreover, by forming the scribe lines on both the surface of the ceramic base material board, the surpluses of the melted brazing material on both the surfaces are smoothly discharged to the outside of the laminated assembly: as a result, it is possible to prevent the metal boards from generating a liquid phase because of falling of the melting point, and the braze stain on the surfaces of the metal boards can be suppressed.', 'In the method for manufacturing ceramic-metal layer assembly of the present invention, the plural scribe lines may be formed on respective the front surface and the back surface of the ceramic base material board.', 'By forming the plurality of scribe lines on both the surfaces of the ceramic base material board, the brazing material melted in the step of joining is easy to be discharged because it is dispersed to the outside of the laminated assembly on both the front surface and the back surface, and the Si density in the metal boards can be uniform in a surface direction. Since the Si density is uniform in the surface direction, the difference of the content amount of the Si atoms dispersed from the brazing material into the metal boards at the front surface side and the back surface side is small: accordingly, the metal boards on both the surfaces can be etched at the same etching rate, and the metal layers can be formed with substantially the same size.', 'Furthermore, since the melted brazing material is dispersed along the plurality of the scribe lines and discharged, the braze lumps can be suppressed from being larger.', 'In the method of manufacturing the ceramic-metal layer assembly of the present invention, it is preferable that in the step of forming scribe lines, the scribe lines that are formed on the front surface of the ceramic base material board and the scribe lines that are formed on the back surface of the ceramic base material board be a same number.', 'By forming the scribe lines with the same number on both the faces of the ceramic base material board, the amounts of the brazing material discharged outside the laminated assembly along the scribe lines are substantially the same on the front surface and the back surface in the step of joining. Thereby the content amount of the Si atoms i.e., the Si density dispersed in the metal boards joined on the front surface and the back surface are the same and the etching rate etching the metal boards are the same, so that the same size of the metal layers can be formed.', 'In the method for manufacturing the ceramic-metal layer assembly, it is applicable that the scribe lines on the front surface of the ceramic base material board and the scribe lines on the back surface of the ceramic base material board be formed at a same position in the surface direction of the ceramic base material board.', 'By forming the scribe lines on the same position on both the face of the ceramic base material board, it is easy to split the ceramic base material board into pieces along the scribe lines, so that a plurality of ceramic circuit boards can be efficiently manufactured.', 'In the method of manufacturing the ceramic-metal layer assembly of the present invention, the positions may be different between the scribe lines formed on the front surface of the ceramic base material board and the scribe lines formed on the back surface of the ceramic base material board in the surface direction of the ceramic base material board.', 'According to the above-described structure, since the number of the scribe lines can be less than the number of the scribe lines which are formed on the same position on both the surfaces of the ceramic base material board, it is possible to reduce works and time for the step of forming scribe lines.', 'A method for manufacturing a ceramic circuit board of the present invention further includes a step of dividing after the step of etching in the above-described method for manufacturing, dividing the ceramic base material board along the scribe lines into pieces of the ceramic boards, so that the ceramic circuit boards in which the metal layers are joined respectively on the front surface and the back surface of the ceramic boards are manufactured.', 'A metal-board-joined ceramic base material board of the present invention is provided with: a ceramic base material board having at least one scribe line on each of a front surface and a back surface, in which the scribe lines are formed along dividing lines for dividing the ceramic base material board into a plurality of ceramic boards; and metal boards joined respectively on the front surface and the back surface of the ceramic base material board, in which the metal boards cover at least a part of dividing lines and are made of aluminum with a thickness dimension not more than 0.4 mm.', 'In the metal-board-joined ceramic base material board of the present invention, a plurality of the scribe lines may be formed respectively on the front surface and the back surface of the ceramic base material board.', 'In the metal-board-joined ceramic base material board of the present invention, the scribe lines formed on the front surface of the ceramic base material board and the scribe lines formed on the back surface of the ceramic base material board may be a same number.', 'In the metal-board-joined ceramic base material board of the present invention, the scribe lines on the front surface of the ceramic base material board and the scribe line on the back surface of the ceramic base material board may be formed at a same position in the surface direction of the ceramic base material board.', 'In the metal-board-joined ceramic base material board of the present invention, the scribe lines on the front surface of the ceramic base material board and the scribe line on the back surface of the ceramic base material board may be formed at different positions in the surface direction of the ceramic base material board.",0

Moreover, when the raw material melt leaking from the crucible drips down and runs down along the pedestal, by stopping the flow of the raw material melt between the pedestal and the center sleeve and solidifying the raw material melt, it is possible to prevent the raw material melt from directly reaching the crucible rotating shaft, which makes it possible to produce a single crystal more safely and reliably.', 'Furthermore, the present invention provides a single crystal production method using the Czochralski method, comprising producing, in a chamber, a single crystal by pulling the single crystal from raw material melt while heating the raw material melt in a crucible with a heater, wherein the single crystal is produced by using the single crystal production apparatus of the present invention.', 'With such a single crystal production method, it is possible to prevent the metal portions below the pedestal from being eroded by the high-temperature raw material melt leaking from the crucible and prevent damage to the apparatus and the occurrence of an accident; it is possible to produce a single crystal safely while preventing degradation of the metal portions of the production apparatus.",0

In particular, by protecting the phenolic hydroxyl group with the protecting group which can be deprotected by heating and/or exposure to electromagnetic radiation and by appropriately selecting the protecting group, there is an increase in the compatibility of the base generator with compounds to be combined, such as a polymer precursor and an acid-base indicator, thereby expanding the range of compounds that can be used in combination or the range of application methods of the base generator. When used for a photosensitive resin composition, the base generator of the present invention can be used in combination with various kinds of polymer precursors.', 'The photosensitive resin composition of the present invention is a highly sensitive photosensitive resin composition because the base generator contained represented by the formula (1) has better sensitivity than conventionally-used photobase generators.

In the deposition part smoothly polished as above, since the retentive force of deposited particulate matter is weak, the particulate matter deposited on the deposition part may easily detach due to the increase of the weight with the increase of the particulate matter or a change of the velocity of the exhaust gas. If the particulate matter deposited on the deposition part detaches, the output of the particulate matter detection sensor is lowered, and accordingly the detection accuracy is lowered.', 'The present invention has been made in view of such background to provide a particulate matter detection element and a particulate matter detection sensor that enable suppressing detaching of particulate matter and increasing the detection accuracy.",2
"However, according to the conventional technology, because all the speed data are replaced with the maximum speed in the speed data in detecting the slide, when a slide or wheel slip occurs, the speed data are replaced with the maximum speed even though they are not actually in the maximum speed. For that reason, there has been a problem in that speed detection accuracy decreases for each time when the slide or wheel slip occurs.', 'The present invention has been made in view of the above, and it is an object to obtain a speed control device capable of detecting speed and location more accurately than before.",2

"However, with the conventional prediction methods for a motion vector, the coding efficiency does not improve in some cases. For example, in the conventional prediction methods, a motion vector of an adjacent block is used. Accordingly, prediction of a motion vector turns out to be largely incorrect in a block having a motion different from the adjacent block, and thus the coding efficiency does not improve.', 'In addition, when the current block is a block located at the upper left of the current picture, the adjacent block is not coded, Thus, the motion vector of the adjacent block cannot be used for the prediction of a motion vector. In this case, prediction of a motion vector is difficult.', 'As described above, the advantageous effect of the improvement of coding efficiency resulting from the prediction of a motion vector cannot be sufficiently obtained with the conventional prediction methods. In view of the above, an object of the present invention is to provide an image coding method for enabling prediction of a motion vector with high accuracy and coding an image with high coding efficiency, and an image decoding method corresponding to the image coding method.",2
